## Summary
Cwm (pronounced koom) is a general-purpose data processing software for the Semantic Web, similar to sed or awk for text files or XSLT for XML. It is a forward chaining semantic reasoner that can be used for querying, checking, transforming and filtering information.  Its core language is RDF, extended to include rules, it can use RDF/XML or RDF/N3 (see Notation3 Primer) serializations.
cwm can perform the following tasks:

Parse and pretty-print the following RDF formats: XML RDF, Notation3, and N-Triples.
Store triples in a queryable triplestore (a triples' database).
Perform inferences as a forward chaining FOPL inference engine.
Perform builtin functions such as comparing strings, retrieving resources, all using an extensible builtins suite.
cwm was written in Python from 2000–10 onwards by Tim Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly of the W3C.
