## Summary
The Molecular Modelling Toolkit (MMTK) is an open-source software package written in Python, which performs common tasks in molecular modelling.

The Molecular Modeling Toolkit is a library that implements common molecular simulation techniques, with an emphasis on biomolecular simulations. It uses modern software engineering techniques (object-oriented design, a high-level language) in order to overcome limitations associated with the large monolithic simulation programs that are commonly used for biomolecules. Its principal advantages are (1) easy extension and combination with other libraries due to modular library design, (2) a single high-level general-purpose programming language (Python) is used for library implementation as well as for application scripts, (3) use of documented and machine-independent formats for all data files, and (4) interfaces to other simulation and visualization programs.
As of 28 April 2011, MMTK consists of about 18,000 lines of Python code, 12,000 lines of hand-written C code, and some machine-generated C code.
