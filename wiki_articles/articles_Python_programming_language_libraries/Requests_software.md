## Summary
Requests is an HTTP client library for the Python programming language.
Requests is one of the most downloaded Python libraries, with over 300 million monthly downloads. It maps the HTTP protocol onto Python's object-oriented semantics. Requests's design has inspired and been copied by HTTP client libraries for other programming languages. It is implemented as a wrapper for urllib3, another third-party Python HTTP library.
