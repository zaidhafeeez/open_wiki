## Summary
Kivy is a free and open source Python framework for developing mobile apps and other multitouch application software with a natural user interface (NUI). It is distributed under the terms of the MIT License, and can run on Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows.
Kivy is the main framework developed by the Kivy organization, alongside Python for Android, Kivy for iOS, and several other libraries meant to be used on all platforms. In 2012, Kivy got a $5000 grant from the Python Software Foundation for porting it to Python 3.3. Kivy also supports the Raspberry Pi which was funded through Bountysource.
The framework contains all the elements for building an application such as:

extensive input support for mouse, keyboard, TUIO, and OS-specific multitouch events;
a graphic library using only OpenGL ES 2, and based on Vertex Buffer Object and shaders;
a wide range of widgets that support multitouch;
an intermediate language (Kv) used to easily design custom widgets.
Kivy is an evolution of the PyMT project.

Code example
Here is an example of the Hello world program with just one button:

Kv language
The Kv language is a language dedicated to describing user interface and interactions in Kivy framework. As with other user interface markup languages, it is possible to easily create a whole UI and attach interaction. For example, to create a Loading dialog that includes a file browser, and a Cancel / Load button, one could first create the base widget in Python and then construct the UI in Kv.
In main.py:

And in the associated Kv:

Alternatively, the layout (here, Box Layout) and the buttons can be loaded directly in the main.py file.
