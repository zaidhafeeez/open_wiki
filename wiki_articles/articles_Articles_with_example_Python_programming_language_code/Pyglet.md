## Content

Pyglet is a library for the Python programming language that provides an object-oriented application programming interface for the creation of games and other multimedia applications. pyglet runs on Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux; it is released under the BSD Licence. pyglet was first created by Alex Holkner.

Features
Pyglet is written entirely in Python. Images, video, and sound files in a range of formats can be done natively but can also be expanded with the libav and ffmpeg libraries. It requires no external dependencies.
Text display and formatting

Rich text formatting (bold, italic, underline, color change, background color, indent, lists) (pyglet.text.formats)
Built-in layouts to support editable text
Carets (pyglet.text.caret.Caret)
HTML support (pyglet.text.layout.IncrementalTextLayout)
Image and sprite work

Fast image processing and rendering
Built-in sprites (pyglet.sprite)
Animated images (*.gif)
Graphics

OpenGL shaders supported
Simple built-in shapes (rectangles, circles, triangles) (pyglet.shapes)
Batched rendering (pyglet.graphics.Batch)
3D model rendering
Events and file system

Resource management (pyglet.resource)
Clock for processing events and time (pyglet.clock.Clock)
Window events (pyglet.window.Window)
Event dispatching (pyglet.event.EventDispatcher)
Context management
Sprites, text layouts, and text functions are implemented. Multi-level lists are supported and can be created using HTML. Different sections of the displayed document can have distinct styles. A built-in caret provides support for text editing, resembling many features of a UI text input caret.

Example
In this example, lines 1-2 import the pyglet module's necessary components. Line 4 creates a window, and line 6 calls pyglet to run its event loop. Optionally an update rate (in frames per second) can be specified in a rate parameter.
