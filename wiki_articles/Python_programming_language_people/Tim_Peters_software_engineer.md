# Tim Peters (software engineer)

## Summary

Tim Peters is a software developer who is known for creating the Timsort hybrid sorting algorithm and for his major contributions to the Python programming language and its original CPython implementation. A pre-1.0 CPython user, he was among the group of early adopters who contributed to the detailed design of the language in its early stages.

## Full Content

Tim Peters is a software developer who is known for creating the Timsort hybrid sorting algorithm and for his major contributions to the Python programming language and its original CPython implementation. A pre-1.0 CPython user, he was among the group of early adopters who contributed to the detailed design of the language in its early stages.
He later created the Timsort algorithm (based on earlier work on the use of "galloping" search) which is used in Python since version 2.3 (since version 3.11 using the Powersort merge policy instead of Timsort's original merge policy), as well as in other widely used computing platforms, including the V8 JavaScript engine powering the Google Chrome and Chromium web browsers, as well as Node.js. He has also contributed the doctest and timeit modules to the Python standard library.
Peters also wrote the Zen of Python, intended as a statement of Python's design philosophy, which was incorporated into the official Python literature as Python Enhancement Proposal 20 and in the Python interpreter as an easter egg. He contributed the chapter on algorithms to the Python Cookbook. From 2001 to 2014 he was active as a member of the Python Software Foundation's board of directors. Peters was an influential contributor to Python mailing lists. He is also a highly ranked contributor to Stack Overflow, mostly for answers relating to Python.
Peters' past employers include Kendall Square Research.
Tim Peters was granted the Python Software Foundation's Distinguished Service Award for 2017.
On August 7, 2024, Tim Peters was suspended by the Python Steering Council for three months due to alleged violations of the Code of Conduct.. Peters has refuted the claims that gave raise to the suspension. The episode triggered widespread backslash against the perceived abuses of the enforcement process against Peters, including a call for a vote of no confidence in the Python Steering Council, which was later withdrawn.
