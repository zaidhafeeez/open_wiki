## Summary
Quixote is a software framework for developing web applications in Python. Quixote "is based on a simple, flexible design, making it possible to write applications quickly and to benefit from the wide range of available third-party Python modules".
A Quixote application is typically a Python package, a collection of modules grouped into a single directory tree. Quixote then maps a URL to a function or method inside the Python package; the function is then called with the contents of the HTTP request, and the results are returned to the client.
