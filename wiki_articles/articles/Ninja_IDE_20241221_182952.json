Even though it is intended to be mainly a Python IDE, it can also handle several other languages.\nStatic and PEP 8 error highlighting.\nShow tips to help migrate code from Python2 to Python3.\nEmbedded Python console.\nProject management, allowing to add, modify and delete files and folders to projects, creating automatically the \"__init__.py\" files inside each module, etc.\nAllows showing/hiding the panels of the interface in a very simple way to fit each programmer's preferences.\nCompletely configurable UI.\nAllows using more than one editor at once.\nAn extensible plug-in system, which creation the IDE supports.\nSession handling: remembers opened files and projects after closing the IDE.\nCode Auto-completion.\nCode Locator: Lets you jump to any code in your project with just a few keystrokes.\n\nVersions names\nNINJA-IDE always takes its version name based on the name of a weapon.\nPrevious Versions:\n\n2.x: Shuriken\n1.x: Kunai\n\nSome available plugins\nMany plugins are being developed, mostly with the help of the Community.\nA complete list of Plugins can be found here:\n\nNINJA-IDE Plugins\n\nSee also\nComparison of integrated development environments for Python\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nPython IDE Wiki\nPython IDE (PyAr)\nLinux Magazine: Do Python coding with NINJA-IDE\nNINJA-IDE a powerful IDE for developing Python Apps\nNINJA-IDE, el ide que me atrapo (in Spanish)\nNINJA-IDE, un IDE pensado para Python (in Spanish)\n",
