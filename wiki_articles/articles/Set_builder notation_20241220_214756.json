In this form, set-builder notation has three parts: a variable, a colon or vertical bar separator, and a predicate. Thus there is a variable on the left of the separator, and a rule on the right of it. These three parts are contained in curly brackets:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        x\n        ∣\n        Φ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{x\\mid \\Phi (x)\\}}\n  \n\nor\n\n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        x\n        :\n        Φ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        }\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{x:\\Phi (x)\\}.}\n  \n\nThe vertical bar (or colon) is a separator that can be read as \"such that\",  \"for which\", or \"with the property that\".  The formula Φ(x) is said to be the rule or the predicate. All values of x for which the predicate holds (is true) belong to the set being defined. All values of x for which the predicate does not hold do not belong to the set.  Thus \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        x\n        ∣\n        Φ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{x\\mid \\Phi (x)\\}}\n  \n is the set of all values of x that satisfy the formula Φ. It may be the empty set, if no value of x satisfies the formula.\n\nSpecifying the domain\nA domain E can appear on the left of the vertical bar: \n\n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        x\n        ∈\n        E\n        ∣\n        Φ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        }\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{x\\in E\\mid \\Phi (x)\\},}\n  \n\nor by adjoining it to the predicate:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        x\n        ∣\n        x\n        ∈\n        E\n        \n           and \n        \n        Φ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        }\n        \n        \n          or\n        \n        \n        {\n        x\n        ∣\n        x\n        ∈\n        E\n        ∧\n        Φ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        }\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{x\\mid x\\in E{\\text{ and }}\\Phi (x)\\}\\quad {\\text{or}}\\quad \\{x\\mid x\\in E\\land \\Phi (x)\\}.}\n  \n\nThe ∈ symbol here denotes set membership, while the \n  \n    \n      \n        ∧\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\land }\n  \n symbol denotes the logical \"and\" operator, known as logical conjunction. This notation represents the set of all values of x that belong to some given set E for which the predicate is true (see \"Set existence axiom\" below). If \n  \n    \n      \n        Φ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Phi (x)}\n  \n is a conjunction \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Φ\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        ∧\n        \n          Φ\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Phi _{1}(x)\\land \\Phi _{2}(x)}\n  \n, then \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        x\n        ∈\n        E\n        ∣\n        Φ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{x\\in E\\mid \\Phi (x)\\}}\n  \n is sometimes written \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        x\n        ∈\n        E\n        ∣\n        \n          Φ\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        ,\n        \n          Φ\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{x\\in E\\mid \\Phi _{1}(x),\\Phi _{2}(x)\\}}\n  \n, using a comma instead of the symbol \n  \n    \n      \n        ∧\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\land }\n  \n.\nIn general, it is not a good idea to consider sets without defining a domain of discourse, as this would represent the subset of all possible things that may exist for which the predicate is true. This can easily lead to contradictions and paradoxes. For example, Russell's paradox shows that the expression \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        x\n         \n        \n          |\n        \n         \n        x\n        ∉\n        x\n        }\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{x~|~x\\not \\in x\\},}\n  \n although seemingly well formed as a set builder expression, cannot define a set without producing a contradiction.\nIn cases where the set E is clear from context, it may be not explicitly specified. It is common in the literature for an author to state the domain ahead of time, and then not specify it in the set-builder notation. For example, an author may say something such as, \"Unless otherwise stated, variables are to be taken to be natural numbers,\" though in less formal contexts where the domain can be assumed, a written mention is often unnecessary.\n\nExamples\nThe following examples illustrate particular sets defined by set-builder notation via predicates. In each case, the domain is specified on the left side of the vertical bar, while the rule is specified on the right side. \n\n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        x\n        ∈\n        \n          R\n        \n        ∣\n        x\n        >\n        0\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{x\\in \\mathbb {R} \\mid x>0\\}}\n  \n is the set of all strictly positive real numbers, which can be written in interval notation as \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        0\n        ,\n        ∞\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (0,\\infty )}\n  \n.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        x\n        ∈\n        \n          R\n        \n        ∣\n        \n          |\n        \n        x\n        \n          |\n        \n        =\n        1\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{x\\in \\mathbb {R} \\mid |x|=1\\}}\n  \n is the set \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        −\n        1\n        ,\n        1\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{-1,1\\}}\n  \n.

Sets defined by set builder notation are equal if and only if their set builder rules, including the domain specifiers, are equivalent. That is \n\n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        x\n        ∈\n        A\n        ∣\n        P\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        }\n        =\n        {\n        x\n        ∈\n        B\n        ∣\n        Q\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{x\\in A\\mid P(x)\\}=\\{x\\in B\\mid Q(x)\\}}\n  \n\nif and only if \n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        ∀\n        t\n        )\n        [\n        (\n        t\n        ∈\n        A\n        ∧\n        P\n        (\n        t\n        )\n        )\n        ⇔\n        (\n        t\n        ∈\n        B\n        ∧\n        Q\n        (\n        t\n        )\n        )\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\forall t)[(t\\in A\\land P(t))\\Leftrightarrow (t\\in B\\land Q(t))]}\n  \n.\nTherefore, in order to prove the equality of two sets defined by set builder notation, it suffices to prove the equivalence of their predicates, including the domain qualifiers.\nFor example,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        x\n        ∈\n        \n          R\n        \n        ∣\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        1\n        }\n        =\n        {\n        x\n        ∈\n        \n          Q\n        \n        ∣\n        \n          |\n        \n        x\n        \n          |\n        \n        =\n        1\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{x\\in \\mathbb {R} \\mid x^{2}=1\\}=\\{x\\in \\mathbb {Q} \\mid |x|=1\\}}\n  \n\nbecause the two rule predicates are logically equivalent:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        x\n        ∈\n        \n          R\n        \n        ∧\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        1\n        )\n        ⇔\n        (\n        x\n        ∈\n        \n          Q\n        \n        ∧\n        \n          |\n        \n        x\n        \n          |\n        \n        =\n        1\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x\\in \\mathbb {R} \\land x^{2}=1)\\Leftrightarrow (x\\in \\mathbb {Q} \\land |x|=1).}\n  \n\nThis equivalence holds because, for any real number x, we have \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x^{2}=1}\n  \n if and only if x is a rational number with \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        x\n        \n          |\n        \n        =\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |x|=1}\n  \n.

Instead, there is a set existence axiom scheme, which states that if E is a set and Φ(x) is a formula in the language of set theory, then there is a set Y whose members are exactly the elements of E that satisfy Φ:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        ∀\n        E\n        )\n        (\n        ∃\n        Y\n        )\n        (\n        ∀\n        x\n        )\n        [\n        x\n        ∈\n        Y\n        ⇔\n        x\n        ∈\n        E\n        ∧\n        Φ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        ]\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\forall E)(\\exists Y)(\\forall x)[x\\in Y\\Leftrightarrow x\\in E\\land \\Phi (x)].}\n  \n\nThe set Y obtained from this axiom is exactly the set described in set builder notation as \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        x\n        ∈\n        E\n        ∣\n        Φ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{x\\in E\\mid \\Phi (x)\\}}\n  \n.\n\nIn programming languages\nA similar notation available in a number of programming languages (notably Python and Haskell) is the list comprehension, which combines map and filter operations over one or more lists.\n\nIn Python, the set-builder's braces are replaced with square brackets, parentheses, or curly braces, giving list, generator, and set objects, respectively. Python uses an English-based syntax. Haskell replaces the set-builder's braces with square brackets and uses symbols, including the standard set-builder vertical bar.\nThe same can be achieved in Scala using Sequence Comprehensions, where the \"for\" keyword returns a list of the yielded variables using the \"yield\" keyword.\nConsider these set-builder notation examples in some programming languages:\n\nThe set builder notation and list comprehension notation are both instances of a more general notation known as monad comprehensions, which permits map/filter-like operations over any monad with a zero element.\n\nSee also\nGlossary of set theory\n\n\n== Notes ==\n",
