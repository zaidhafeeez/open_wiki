In about 1150, the Indian mathematician Bhaskaracharya gave an exposition of binomial coefficients in his book Līlāvatī.\nAlternative notations include C(n, k), nCk, nCk, Ckn, Cnk, and Cn,k, in all of which the C stands for combinations or choices; the C notation means the number of ways to choose k out of n objects. Many calculators use variants of the C notation because they can represent it on a single-line display. In this form the binomial coefficients are easily compared to the numbers of k-permutations of n, written as P(n, k), etc.\n\nDefinition and interpretations\nFor natural numbers (taken to include 0) n and k, the binomial coefficient \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                (\n              \n              \n                n\n                k\n              \n              \n                )\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tbinom {n}{k}}}\n  \n can be defined as the coefficient of the monomial Xk in the expansion of (1 + X)n. The same coefficient also occurs (if k ≤ n) in the binomial formula\n\n(valid for any elements x, y of a commutative ring),\nwhich explains the name \"binomial coefficient\".\nAnother occurrence of this number is in combinatorics, where it gives the number of ways, disregarding order, that k objects can be chosen from among n objects; more formally, the number of k-element subsets (or k-combinations) of an n-element set. This number can be seen as equal to the one of the first definition, independently of any of the formulas below to compute it: if in each of the n factors of the power (1 + X)n one temporarily labels the term X with an index i (running from 1 to n), then each subset of k indices gives after expansion a contribution Xk, and the coefficient of that monomial in the result will be the number of such subsets. This shows in particular that \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                (\n              \n              \n                n\n                k\n              \n              \n                )\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tbinom {n}{k}}}\n  \n is a natural number for any natural numbers n and k. There are many other combinatorial interpretations of binomial coefficients (counting problems for which the answer is given by a binomial coefficient expression), for instance the number of words formed of n bits (digits 0 or 1) whose sum is k is given by \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                (\n              \n              \n                n\n                k\n              \n              \n                )\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tbinom {n}{k}}}\n  \n, while the number of ways to write \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n        =\n        \n          a\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        ⋯\n        +\n        \n          a\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k=a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots +a_{n}}\n  \n where every ai is a nonnegative integer is given by ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                (\n              \n              \n                \n                  n\n                  +\n                  k\n                  −\n                  1\n                \n                \n                  n\n                  −\n                  1\n                \n              \n              \n                )\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tbinom {n+k-1}{n-1}}}\n  \n⁠.

raised to the nth power. This is obtained from the binomial theorem (∗) by setting x = 1 and y = 1. The formula also has a natural combinatorial interpretation: the left side sums the number of subsets of {1, ..., n} of sizes k = 0, 1, ..., n, giving the total number of subsets. (That is, the left side counts the power set of {1, ..., n}.) However, these subsets can also be generated by successively choosing or excluding each element 1, ..., n; the n independent binary choices (bit-strings) allow a total of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          2\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2^{n}}\n  \n choices.

In terms of labelled combinatorial objects, the connection coefficients represent the number of ways to assign m + n − k labels to a pair of labelled combinatorial objects—of weight m and n respectively—that have had their first k labels identified, or glued together to get a new labelled combinatorial object of weight m + n − k.

One can show that the generalized binomial coefficient is well-defined, in the sense that no matter what set we choose to represent the cardinal number \n  \n    \n      \n        α\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha }\n  \n, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              (\n            \n            \n              α\n              β\n            \n            \n              )\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle {\\alpha  \\choose \\beta }}\n  \n will remain the same. For finite cardinals, this definition coincides with the standard definition of the binomial coefficient.\nAssuming the Axiom of Choice, one can show that \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              (\n            \n            \n              α\n              α\n            \n            \n              )\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          2\n          \n            α\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle {\\alpha  \\choose \\alpha }=2^{\\alpha }}\n  \n for any infinite cardinal \n  \n    \n      \n        α\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha }\n  \n.\n\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\"Binomial coefficients\", Encyclopedia of Mathematics, EMS Press, 2001 [1994]\nAndrew Granville (1997). \"Arithmetic Properties of Binomial Coefficients I.
