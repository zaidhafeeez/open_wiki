It is available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. The latest version of PIL is 1.1.7, was released in September 2009 and supports Python 1.5.2–2.7.\nDevelopment of the original project, known as PIL, was discontinued in 2011. Subsequently, a successor project named Pillow forked the PIL repository and added Python 3.x support. This fork has been adopted as a replacement for the original PIL in Linux distributions including Debian and Ubuntu (since 13.04).\n\nCapabilities\nPIL offers several standard procedures for image manipulation. These include:\n\nper-pixel manipulations,\nmasking and transparency handling,\nimage filtering, such as blurring, contouring, smoothing, or edge finding,\nimage enhancing, such as sharpening, adjusting brightness, contrast or color,\nadding text\n\nFile formats\nSupported file formats include PPM, PNG, JPEG, GIF, TIFF, and BMP.\nPIL is extensible, allowing users to create custom decoders for any file format.\n\nProgramming examples\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nPIL Library reference\n Python Imaging Library at Wikibooks\nPillow (Successor project)\nPIL Tutorial Examples\n",
