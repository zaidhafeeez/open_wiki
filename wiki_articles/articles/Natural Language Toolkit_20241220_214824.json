It supports classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning functionalities. It was developed by Steven Bird and Edward Loper in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. NLTK includes graphical demonstrations and sample data. It is accompanied by a book that explains the underlying concepts behind the language processing tasks supported by the toolkit, plus a cookbook.\nNLTK is intended to support research and teaching in NLP or closely related areas, including empirical linguistics, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, information retrieval, and machine learning.\nNLTK has been used successfully as a teaching tool, as an individual study tool, and as a platform for prototyping and building research systems. There are 32 universities in the US and 25 countries using NLTK in their courses.\n\nLibrary highlights\nDiscourse representation\nLexical analysis: Word and text tokenizer\nn-gram and collocations\nPart-of-speech tagger\nTree model and Text chunker for capturing\nNamed-entity recognition\n\nSee also\nSpaCy\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\n",
