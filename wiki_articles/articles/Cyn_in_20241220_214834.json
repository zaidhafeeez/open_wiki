Cyn.in is developed by Cynapse a company founded by Apurva Roy Choudhury and Dhiraj Gupta which is based in India. Cyn.in enables its users to store, retrieve and organize files and rich content in a collaborative, multiuser environment.\nCyn.in comes in three flavors. Cyn.in Community Edition is released under the GNU\n\n## Full Content\n\nCyn.in is an open-source enterprise collaborative software built on top of Plone a content management system written in the Python programming language which is a layer above Zope. Cyn.in is developed by Cynapse a company founded by Apurva Roy Choudhury and Dhiraj Gupta which is based in India. Cyn.in enables its users to store, retrieve and organize files and rich content in a collaborative, multiuser environment.\nCyn.in comes in three flavors. Cyn.in Community Edition is released under the GNU General Public License version 3 based on open standards and is completely \"free\" to use. Cyn.in Enterprise Editions are commercially supported, certified and tested by Cynapse. The on-premises appliance is designed towards businesses who want to install the software on their infrastructure behind their firewall. With the On-Demand Service, Cynapse hosts the software for businesses to use, in secure cloud servers.\n\nHistory\nCyn.in was developed and released in late 2006 as a closed source Enterprise Bliki software, based on the .NET Framework as a SaaS offering by Cynapse. In 2008, June, Cynapse, the company behind Cyn.in, released a new version of Cyn.in and open sourced the project. This release was built on the popular open source Plone - Zope - Python framework. With this release Cynapse's intention was to expand its focus into the enterprise collaboration domain. While the new release still supported Blogs and Wikis, Cyn.in had evolved to include enterprise collaboration tools including file repositories, event calendars, image galleries and more. The company decided to discontinue using the Bliki terminology and Cyn.in is called a Collaboration software\n\nConcepts\nApplication convergence\nThe cyn.in collaborative information management system attempts to bring together the core concepts of:\n\nPersonal information management\nOrganization-wide knowledge and document management\nInformation and file collaboration\nKnowledge transfer\nContent publishing\n\nSpaces\nInformation can be made available in four different location namespaces, called Personal Space, Shared Space, Intranet Space and Web Space within the cyn.in application. Each Space has distinct authorization and functionality rules, for example, the Intranet Space of a cyn.in site may only be accessed by members of it, in contrast to the Web Space, where public Internet access is allowed.\n\nNotes\nInformation and files in cyn.in are stored together in a common container format called a Note. A user can create any number of Notes in the system, however a Note can only reside in one Space at a time.\n\nTaxonomy and categorization\nNotes can have one or more SlashTags. SlashTags is the name given to the hierarchical tagging system used in cyn.in to categorize Notes and is used for creation of navigation trees and dynamic pop-out menus. SlashTags offer taxonomical advantages when compared to traditional folder based systems because they enable:\n\ndirect navigational access to each Note\nmultiple presences of the same Note in the navigation system\n\nKey Features\nDue to the emergent nature of the open source and hosted service model, the exact feature specification of the cyn.in service is updated regularly. The following core features are currently visible:\n\nWiki support\nBlog support\nCalendaring\nMicroblogging\nBookmark Directories\nDiscussion Boards\nAudio and Video Galleries\nFile Repositories\nImage Galleries and slideshow views of images\nCollaboration Spaces\nCustomizable Permissions and Access control\nIntegrated WYSIWYG Word Processor\nWYSIWYG creation and editing of HTML content tables\nContent Ratings\nContent Tagging support\nPeople Directory\nWorking Copy support\nLink and reference integrity maintenance\nAutomatic locking and unlocking\nComplete revision history of all content and files\nWorkflow capabilities\nIntegrated Full Text indexing of (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, HTML, Text and other file formats)\nRules engine for content\nAuto-generated tables of contents\nMulti-file uploads\nLive Search\nFaceted Search\ni18n support\nAccessibility compliant\nTime-based publishing and expiry of content\nStandards-compliant XHTML and CSS\nRSS syndication of content and files\nAutomatic image scaling and thumbnail generation\nCross-platform\nComment capabilities on any content\nWebDAV support\nBackup support\nCut/copy/paste operations on content\nEmail notifications\nDesktop Client \nAutomatic Backlinking\nGranular rights based content editing and user-to-user collaboration\nAccess rights based AJAX user interface\nCo - author rich content, files and documents\nSelectively move content from private to public spaces\nSensible, easy-to-remember URLs\nServer based image resizing for preview and download\n\nApplications\nDesigned to be used generically, the cyn.in bliki service can be applied in the following business applications:\n\nKnowledge management\nDocument management\nEnterprise content management\nDigital asset management\nOnline file system\nVersion control system\nGroup Collaboration\n\nPricing model\nThe cyn.in service is made available for purchase by businesses in the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model at a flexible per user cost. cyn.in is a multi-tenant system; each customer of cyn.in may purchase one or more cyn.in sites each of which are located at a user selectable subdomain of the main cyn.in service. Each site allows a set of users to log into it to access internal functionality; the service offers a central user authentication system and thus allows the same users to be members of different cyn.in sites as well.\nA free version is also available for individual professionals with some limitations in storage and the maximum number of users that are allowed.\n\nAwards\n2009\nLes Trop√©es du Libre (nominee)\nSourceForge Community Choice Awards - Finalist in 3 categories  - Best New Project, Best Commercial Open Source Project & Best Visual Design\n\nSee also\nEnterprise social software\nList of collaborative software\nList of content management systems\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nOfficial Cyn.in Software Buy / Purchase Link\nCynapse Blog Archived 2009-03-03 at the Wayback Machine\nUser and Administration Wiki Documentation\nCyn.in listed as an add-on product on the Plone Website\nCyn.in Desktop client listing in the Flex showcase\n",
