It uses modern software engineering techniques (object-oriented design, a high-level language) in order to overcome limitations associated with the large monolithic simulation programs that are commonly used for biomolecules. Its principal advantages are (1) easy extension and combination with other libraries due to modular library design, (2) a single high-level general-purpose programming language (Python) is used for library implementation as well as for application scripts, (3) use of documented and machine-independent formats for all data files, and (4) interfaces to other simulation and visualization programs.\nAs of 28 April 2011, MMTK consists of about 18,000 lines of Python code, 12,000 lines of hand-written C code, and some machine-generated C code.\n\nFeatures\nconstruction of molecular systems, with special support for proteins and nucleic acids\ninfinite systems or periodic boundary conditions (orthorhombic elementary cells)\ncommon geometrical operations on coordinates\nrigid-body fits\nvisualization using external PDB and VRML viewers; animation of dynamics trajectories and normal modes\nthe AMBER 94 force field, with several options for handling electrostatic interactions\na deformation force field for fast normal mode calculations on proteins\nenergy minimization (steepest descent and conjugate gradient)\nmolecular dynamics (with optional thermostat, barostat, and distance constraints)\nnormal mode analysis\ntrajectory operations\npoint charge fits\nmolecular surface calculations\ninterfaces to other programs\n\nSee also\nSoftware for molecular mechanics modelling\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nBackground information\n",
