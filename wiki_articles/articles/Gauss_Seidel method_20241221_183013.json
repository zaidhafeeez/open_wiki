It is named after the German mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss and Philipp Ludwig von Seidel. Though it can be applied to any matrix with non-zero elements on the diagonals, convergence is only guaranteed if the matrix is either strictly diagonally dominant, or symmetric and positive definite. It was only mentioned in a private letter from Gauss to his student Gerling in 1823. A publication was not delivered before 1874 by Seidel.\n\nDescription\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n        \n        \n          x\n        \n        =\n        \n          b\n

The procedure is generally continued until the changes made by an iteration are below some tolerance, such as a sufficiently small residual.\n\nDiscussion\nThe element-wise formula for the Gauss–Seidel method is related to that of the (iterative) Jacobi method, with an important difference:\nIn Gauss-Seidel, the computation of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            x\n          \n          \n            (\n            k\n            +\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {x} ^{(k+1)}}\n  \n uses the elements of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            x\n          \n          \n            (\n            k\n            +\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {x} ^{(k+1)}}\n  \n that have already been computed, and only the elements of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            x\n          \n          \n            (\n            k\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {x} ^{(k)}}\n  \n that have not been computed in the \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        k\n        +\n        1\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (k+1)}\n  \n-th iteration. This means that, unlike the Jacobi method, only one storage vector is required as elements can be overwritten as they are computed, which can be advantageous for very large problems.\nHowever, unlike the Jacobi method, the computations for each element are generally much harder to implement in parallel, since they can have a very long critical path, and are thus most feasible for sparse matrices. Furthermore, the values at each iteration are dependent on the order of the original equations.\nGauss-Seidel is the same as successive over-relaxation with \n  \n    \n      \n        ω\n        =\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\omega =1}\n  \n.\n\nConvergence\nThe convergence properties of the Gauss–Seidel method are dependent on the matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {A} }\n  \n.
