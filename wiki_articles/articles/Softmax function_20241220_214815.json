It is a generalization of the logistic function to multiple dimensions, and is used in multinomial logistic regression. The softmax function is often used as the last activation function of a neural network to normalize the output of a network to a probability distribution over predicted output classes.\n\nDefinition\nThe softmax function takes as input a vector z of K real numbers, and normalizes it into a probability distribution consisting of K probabilities proportional to the exponentials of the input numbers. That is, prior to applying softmax, some vector components could be negative, or greater than one; and might not sum to 1; but after applying softmax, each component will be in the interval \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (0,1)}\n  \n, and the components will add up to 1, so that they can be interpreted as probabilities. Furthermore, the larger input components will correspond to larger probabilities. \nFormally, the standard (unit) softmax function \n  \n    \n      \n        σ\n        :\n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            K\n          \n        \n        →\n        (\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        \n          )\n          \n            K\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma \\colon \\mathbb {R} ^{K}\\to (0,1)^{K}}\n  \n, where \n  \n    \n      \n        K\n        >\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K>1}\n  \n, takes a vector \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          z\n        \n        =\n        (\n        \n          z\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        \n          z\n          \n            K\n          \n        \n        )\n        ∈\n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            K\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {z} =(z_{1},\\dotsc ,z_{K})\\in \\mathbb {R} ^{K}}\n  \n and computes each component of vector \n  \n    \n      \n        σ\n        (\n        \n          z\n        \n        )\n        ∈\n        (\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        \n          )\n          \n            K\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma (\\mathbf {z} )\\in (0,1)^{K}}\n  \n with\n\n  \n    \n      \n        σ\n        (\n        \n          z\n        \n        \n          )\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              e\n              \n                \n                  z\n                  \n                    i\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                ∑\n                \n                  j\n                  =\n                  1\n                \n                \n                  K\n                \n              \n              \n                e\n                \n                  \n                    z\n                    \n                      j\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma (\\mathbf {z} )_{i}={\\frac {e^{z_{i}}}{\\sum _{j=1}^{K}e^{z_{j}}}}\\,.}\n  \n\nIn words, the softmax applies the standard exponential function to each element \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          z\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle z_{i}}\n  \n of the input vector \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          z\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {z} }\n  \n (consisting of \n  \n    \n      \n        K\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K}\n  \n real numbers), and normalizes these values by dividing by the sum of all these exponentials.

The term \"softmax\" derives from the amplifying effects of the exponential on any maxima in the input vector. For example, the standard softmax of \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        1\n        ,\n        2\n        ,\n        8\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (1,2,8)}\n  \n is approximately \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        0.001\n        ,\n        0.002\n        ,\n        0.997\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (0.001,0.002,0.997)}\n  \n, which amounts to assigning almost all of the total unit weight in the result to the position of the vector's maximal element (of 8).\nIn general, instead of e a different base b > 0 can be used.  As above, if b > 1 then larger input components will result in larger output probabilities, and increasing the value of b will create probability distributions that are more concentrated around the positions of the largest input values. Conversely, if 0 < b < 1 then smaller input components will result in larger output probabilities, and decreasing the value of b will create probability distributions that are more concentrated around the positions of the smallest input values.

A higher temperature results in a more uniform output distribution (i.e. with higher entropy; it is \"more random\"), while a lower temperature results in a sharper output distribution, with one value dominating.\nIn some fields, the base is fixed, corresponding to a fixed scale, while in others the parameter β (or T) is varied.\n\nInterpretations\nSmooth arg max\nThe Softmax function is a smooth approximation to the arg max function: the function whose value is the index of a vector's largest element. The name \"softmax\" may be misleading. Softmax is not a smooth maximum (that is, a smooth approximation to the maximum function). The term \"softmax\" is also used for the closely related LogSumExp function, which is a smooth maximum.

There are various notions of convergence of a function; softargmax converges to arg max pointwise, meaning for each fixed input z as ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        β\n        →\n        ∞\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\beta \\to \\infty }\n  \n⁠, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          σ\n          \n            β\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          z\n        \n        )\n        →\n        \n          a\n          r\n          g\n          \n          m\n          a\n          x\n        \n        ⁡\n        (\n        \n          z\n        \n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma _{\\beta }(\\mathbf {z} )\\to \\operatorname {arg\\,max} (\\mathbf {z} ).}\n  \n However, softargmax does not converge uniformly to arg max, meaning intuitively that different points converge at different rates, and may converge arbitrarily slowly. In fact, softargmax is continuous, but arg max is not continuous at the singular set where two coordinates are equal, while the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous. The reason it fails to converge uniformly is that for inputs where two coordinates are almost equal (and one is the maximum), the arg max is the index of one or the other, so a small change in input yields a large change in output.

This approach, while not altering the output or the derivative theoretically, enhances stability by directly controlling the maximum exponent value computed.\nIf the function is scaled with the parameter \n  \n    \n      \n        β\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\beta }\n  \n, then these expressions must be multiplied by \n  \n    \n      \n        β\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\beta }\n  \n.\nSee multinomial logit for a probability model which uses the softmax activation function.\n\nReinforcement learning\nIn the field of reinforcement learning, a softmax function can be used to convert values into action probabilities.

For a low temperature (\n  \n    \n      \n        τ\n        →\n        \n          0\n          \n            +\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tau \\to 0^{+}}\n  \n), the probability of the action with the highest expected reward tends to 1.\n\nComputational complexity and remedies\nIn neural network applications, the number K of possible outcomes is often large, e.g. in case of neural language models that predict the most likely outcome out of a vocabulary which might contain millions of possible words. This can make the calculations for the softmax layer (i.e. the matrix multiplications to determine the \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          z\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle z_{i}}\n  \n, followed by the application of the softmax function itself) computationally expensive. What's more, the gradient descent backpropagation method for training such a neural network involves calculating the softmax for every training example, and the number of training examples can also become large. The computational effort for the softmax became a major limiting factor in the development of larger neural language models, motivating various remedies to reduce training times.\nApproaches that reorganize the softmax layer for more efficient calculation include the hierarchical softmax and the differentiated softmax. The hierarchical softmax (introduced by Morin and Bengio in 2005) uses a binary tree structure where the outcomes (vocabulary words) are the leaves and the intermediate nodes are suitably selected \"classes\" of outcomes, forming latent variables. The desired probability (softmax value) of a leaf (outcome) can then be calculated as the product of the probabilities of all nodes on the path from the root to that leaf. Ideally, when the tree is balanced, this would reduce the computational complexity from \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        K\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(K)}\n  \n to \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          log\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ⁡\n        K\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(\\log _{2}K)}\n  \n. In practice, results depend on choosing a good strategy for clustering the outcomes into classes. A Huffman tree was used for this in Google's word2vec models (introduced in 2013) to achieve scalability.\nA second kind of remedies is based on approximating the softmax (during training) with modified loss functions that avoid the calculation of the full normalization factor. These include methods that restrict the normalization sum to a sample of outcomes (e.g. Importance Sampling, Target Sampling).\n\nMathematical properties\nGeometrically the softmax function maps the

foundational paper Boltzmann (1868), formalized and popularized in the influential textbook Gibbs (1902).\nThe use of the softmax in decision theory is credited to R. Duncan Luce,: 1  who used the axiom of independence of irrelevant alternatives in rational choice theory to deduce the softmax in Luce's choice axiom for relative preferences.\nIn machine learning, the term \"softmax\" is credited to John S. Bridle in two 1989 conference papers, Bridle (1990a):: 1  and Bridle (1990b):\n\nWe are concerned with feed-forward non-linear networks (multi-layer perceptrons, or MLPs) with multiple outputs. We wish to treat the outputs of the network as probabilities of alternatives (e.g. pattern classes), conditioned on the inputs. We look for appropriate output non-linearities and for appropriate criteria for adaptation of the parameters of the network (e.g. weights). We explain two modifications: probability scoring, which is an alternative to squared error minimisation, and a normalised exponential (softmax) multi-input generalisation of the logistic non-linearity.: 227 \n\nFor any input, the outputs must all be positive and they must sum to unity. ...\nGiven a set of unconstrained values, ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          V\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V_{j}(x)}\n  \n⁠, we can ensure both conditions by using a Normalised Exponential transformation:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Q\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n          \n            e\n            \n              \n                V\n                \n                  j\n                \n              \n              (\n              x\n              )\n            \n          \n          /\n        \n        \n          ∑\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        \n          e\n          \n            \n              V\n              \n                k\n              \n            \n            (\n            x\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Q_{j}(x)=\\left.e^{V_{j}(x)}\\right/\\sum _{k}e^{V_{k}(x)}}\n  \n\nThis transformation can be considered a multi-input generalisation of the logistic, operating on the whole output layer. It preserves the rank order of its input values, and is a differentiable generalisation of the 'winner-take-all' operation of picking the maximum value. For this reason we like to refer to it as softmax.: 213\n\nExample\nWith an input of (1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3), the softmax is approximately (0.024, 0.064, 0.175, 0.475, 0.024, 0.064, 0.175). The output has most of its weight where the \"4\" was in the original input. This is what the function is normally used for: to highlight the largest values and suppress values which are significantly below the maximum value. But note: a change of temperature changes the output.  When the temperature is multiplied by 10, the inputs are effectively (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) and the softmax is approximately (0.125, 0.138, 0.153, 0.169, 0.125, 0.138, 0.153). This shows that high temperatures de-emphasize the maximum value.\nComputation of this example using Python code:\n\nAlternatives\nThe softmax function generates probability predictions densely distributed over its support. Other functions like sparsemax or α-entmax can be used when sparse probability predictions are desired. Also the Gumbel-softmax reparametrization trick can be used when sampling from a discrete-discrete distribution needs to be mimicked in a differentiable manner.\n\nSee also\nSoftplus\nMultinomial logistic regression\nDirichlet distribution – an alternative way to sample categorical distributions\nPartition function\nExponential tilting – a generalization of Softmax to more general probability distributions\n\nNotes\n\n\n== References ==\n",
