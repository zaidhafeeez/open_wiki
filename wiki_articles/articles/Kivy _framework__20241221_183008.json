It is distributed under the terms of the MIT License, and can run on Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows.\nKivy is the main framework developed by the Kivy organization, alongside Python for Android, Kivy for iOS, and several other libraries meant to be used on all platforms. In 2012, Kivy got a $5000 grant from the Python Software Foundation for porting it to Python 3.3. Kivy also supports the Raspberry Pi which was funded through Bountysource.\nThe framework contains all the elements for building an application such as:\n\nextensive input support for mouse, keyboard, TUIO, and OS-specific multitouch events;\na graphic library using only OpenGL ES 2, and based on Vertex Buffer Object and shaders;\na wide range of widgets that support multitouch;\nan intermediate language (Kv) used to easily design custom widgets.\nKivy is an evolution of the PyMT project.\n\nCode example\nHere is an example of the Hello world program with just one button:\n\nKv language\nThe Kv language is a language dedicated to describing user interface and interactions in Kivy framework. As with other user interface markup languages, it is possible to easily create a whole UI and attach interaction. For example, to create a Loading dialog that includes a file browser, and a Cancel / Load button, one could first create the base widget in Python and then construct the UI in Kv.\nIn main.py:\n\nAnd in the associated Kv:\n\nAlternatively, the layout (here, Box Layout) and the buttons can be loaded directly in the main.py file.\n\nRelated projects\nBuildozer, generic Python packager for Android and iOS.\nPlyer, platform-independent Python wrapper for platform-dependent APIs.\nPyJNIus, dynamic access to the Java/Android API from Python.\nPyobjus, dynamic access to the Objective-C/iOS API from Python.\nPython for Android, toolchain for building and packaging Python applications for Android.\nKivy for iOS, toolchain for building and packaging Kivy applications for iOS.\nAudiostream, library for direct access to the microphone and speaker.\nKivEnt, entity-based game engine for Kivy.\nKivy Garden, widgets and libraries created and maintained by community.\nKivy SDK Packager, scripts for Kivy SDK generation on Windows, macOS and Linux.\nKivy Remote Shell, remote SSH+Python interactive shell application.\nKivyPie, Raspbian-based distribution running latest Kivy framework on the Raspberry Pi.\nOSCPy, a fast and reliable OSC implementation.\nCondiment, preprocessor that includes or removes Python code portion, according to environment variables.\nKivyAuth, social login via Google, Facebook, GitHub and Twitter accounts in Kivy apps.\nKivMob, AdMob support for Kivy apps.\nKivyMD, a set of Material Design widgets for Kivy.\n\nGoogle Summer of Code\nKivy participated in Google Summer of Code under the Python Software Foundation.\n\nKivy in GSoC'2014.\nKivy in GSoC'2015.\nKivy in GSoC'2016.\nKivy in GSoC'2017.\n\nSee also\nPygame, another Python game API, a layer over Simple DirectMedia Layer\nCocos2d\nPanda3D\nPyglet\nScripting Layer for Android\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\n",
