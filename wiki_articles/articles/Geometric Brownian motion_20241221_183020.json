This was the model postulated by Louis Bachelier in 1900 for stock prices, in the first published attempt to model Brownian motion, known today as Bachelier model. As was shown above, the ABM SDE can be obtained through the logarithm of a GBM via Itô's formula. Similarly, a GBM can be obtained by exponentiation of an ABM through Itô's formula.\n\nProperties of GBM\nThe above solution \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          S\n          \n            t\n

price behavior.\nSome of the arguments for using GBM to model stock prices are:\n\nThe expected returns of GBM are independent of the value of the process (stock price), which agrees with what we would expect in reality.\nA GBM process only assumes positive values, just like real stock prices.\nA GBM process shows the same kind of 'roughness' in its paths as we see in real stock prices.\nCalculations with GBM processes are relatively easy.\nHowever, GBM is not a completely realistic model, in particular it falls short of reality in the following points:\n\nIn real stock prices, volatility changes over time (possibly stochastically), but in GBM, volatility is assumed constant.\nIn real life, stock prices often show jumps caused by unpredictable events or news, but in GBM, the path is continuous (no discontinuity).\nApart from modeling stock prices, Geometric Brownian motion has also found applications in the monitoring of trading strategies.\n\nExtensions\nIn an attempt to make GBM more realistic as a model for stock prices, also in relation to the volatility smile problem, one can drop the assumption that the volatility (\n  \n    \n      \n        σ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma }\n  \n) is constant. If we assume that the volatility is a deterministic function of the stock price and time, this is called a local volatility model. A straightforward extension of the Black Scholes GBM is a local volatility SDE whose distribution is a mixture of distributions of GBM, the lognormal mixture dynamics, resulting in a convex combination of Black Scholes prices for options. If instead we assume that the volatility has a randomness of its own—often described by a different equation driven by a different Brownian Motion—the model is called a stochastic volatility model, see for example the Heston model.\n\nSee also\nBrownian surface\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nGeometric Brownian motion models for stock movement except in rare events.\nExcel Simulation of a Geometric Brownian Motion to simulate Stock Prices \n\"Interactive Web Application: Stochastic Processes used in Quantitative Finance\".
