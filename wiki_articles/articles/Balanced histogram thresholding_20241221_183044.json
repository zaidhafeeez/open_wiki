Like Otsu's Method and the Iterative Selection Thresholding Method, this is a histogram based thresholding method. This approach assumes that the image is divided in two main classes: The background and the foreground. The BHT method tries to find the optimum threshold level that divides the histogram in two classes.\n\nThis method weighs the histogram, checks which of the two sides is heavier, and removes weight from the heavier side until it becomes the lighter. It repeats the same operation until the edges of the weighing scale meet.\nGiven its simplicity, this method is a good choice as a first approach when presenting the subject of automatic image thresholding.\n\nAlgorithm\nThe following listing, in C notation, is a simplified version of the Balanced Histogram Thresholding method:\n\nThe following, is a possible implementation in the Python language:\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nImageJ Plugin Archived 2013-10-17 at the Wayback Machine\nOtsu vs. BHT\n",
