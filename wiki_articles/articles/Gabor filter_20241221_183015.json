Frequency and orientation representations of Gabor filters are claimed by many contemporary vision scientists to be similar to those of the human visual system. They have been found to be particularly appropriate for texture representation and discrimination. In the spatial domain, a 2D Gabor filter is a Gaussian kernel function modulated by a sinusoidal plane wave (see Gabor transform).\nSome authors claim that simple cells in the visual cortex of mammalian brains can be modeled by Gabor functions. Thus, image analysis with Gabor filters is thought by some to be similar to perception in the human visual system.\n\nDefinition\nIts impulse response is defined by a sinusoidal wave (a plane wave for 2D Gabor filters) multiplied by a Gaussian function.\nBecause of the multiplication-convolution property (Convolution theorem), the Fourier transform of a Gabor filter's impulse response is the convolution of the Fourier transform of the harmonic function (sinusoidal function) and the Fourier transform of the Gaussian function.  The filter has a real and an imaginary component representing orthogonal directions.  The two components may be formed into a complex number or used individually.\nComplex\n\n  \n    \n      \n        g\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ;\n        λ\n        ,\n

and rotations. However, in general, expansion is not applied for Gabor wavelets, since this requires computation of bi-orthogonal wavelets, which may be very time-consuming. Therefore, usually, a filter bank consisting of Gabor filters with various scales and rotations is created. The filters are convolved with the signal, resulting in a so-called Gabor space. This process is closely related to processes in the primary visual cortex.\nJones and Palmer showed that the real part of the complex Gabor function is a good fit to the receptive field weight functions found in simple cells in a cat's striate cortex.\n\nTime-causal analogue of the Gabor filter\nWhen processing temporal signals, data from the future cannot be accessed, which leads to problems if attempting to use Gabor functions for processing real-time signals that depend on the temporal dimension. A time-causal analogue of the Gabor filter has been developed in  based on replacing the Gaussian kernel in the Gabor function with a time-causal and time-recursive kernel referred to as the time-causal limit kernel. In this way, time-frequency analysis based on the resulting complex-valued extension of the time-causal limit kernel makes it possible to capture essentially similar transformations of a temporal signal as the Gabor filter can, and as can  be described by the Heisenberg group, see  for further details.\n\nExtraction of features from images\nA set of Gabor filters with different frequencies and orientations may be helpful for extracting useful features from an image.

By varying \n  \n    \n      \n        θ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta }\n  \n, we can look for texture oriented in a particular direction. By varying \n  \n    \n      \n        σ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma }\n  \n, we change the support of the basis or the size of the image region being analyzed.\n\nApplications of 2D Gabor filters in image processing\nIn document image processing, Gabor features are ideal for identifying the script of a word in a multilingual document. Gabor filters with different frequencies and with orientations in different directions have been used to localize and extract text-only regions from complex document images (both gray and colour), since text is rich in high frequency components, whereas pictures are relatively smooth in nature. It has also been applied for facial expression recognition \nGabor filters have also been widely used in pattern analysis applications. For example, it has been used to study the directionality distribution inside the porous spongy trabecular bone in the spine. The Gabor space is very useful in image processing applications such as optical character recognition, iris recognition and fingerprint recognition. Relations between activations for a specific spatial location are very distinctive between objects in an image. Furthermore, important activations can be extracted from the Gabor space in order to create a sparse object representation.\n\nExample implementations\nPython\nThis is an example implementation in Python:\n\nFor an implementation on images, see [1].\n\nMATLAB\nThis is an example implementation in MATLAB/Octave:\n\nCode for Gabor feature extraction from images in MATLAB can be found at http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/44630.\n\nHaskell\nThis is another example implementation in Haskell:\n\nSee also\nGabor transform\nGabor wavelet\nGabor atom\nLog Gabor filter\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nMATLAB code for Gabor filters and Gabor feature extraction\n3D Gabor demonstrated with Mathematica\npython implementation of log-Gabors for still images\nGabor filter for image processing and computer vision (demonstration) Archived 2018-05-29 at the Wayback Machine\n\nFurther reading\nFeichtinger, Hans G.; Strohmer, Thomas, eds.
