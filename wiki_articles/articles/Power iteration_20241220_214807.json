Thus, the method converges slowly if there is an eigenvalue close in magnitude to the dominant eigenvalue.\n\nApplications\nAlthough the power iteration method approximates only one eigenvalue of a matrix, it remains useful for certain computational problems. For instance, Google uses it to calculate the PageRank of documents in their search engine, and Twitter uses it to show users recommendations of whom to follow. The power iteration method is especially suitable for sparse matrices, such as the web matrix, or as the matrix-free method that does not require storing the coefficient matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A}\n  \n explicitly, but can instead access a function evaluating matrix-vector products \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Ax}\n  \n. For non-symmetric matrices that are well-conditioned the power iteration method can outperform more complex Arnoldi iteration. For symmetric matrices, the power iteration method is rarely used, since its convergence speed can be easily increased without sacrificing the small cost per iteration; see, e.g., Lanczos iteration and LOBPCG.\nSome of the more advanced eigenvalue algorithms can be understood as variations of the power iteration. For instance, the inverse iteration method applies power iteration to the matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \n            −\n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A^{-1}}\n  \n. Other algorithms look at the whole subspace generated by the vectors \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b_{k}}\n  \n. This subspace is known as the Krylov subspace. It can be computed by Arnoldi iteration or Lanczos iteration.\nGram iteration is a super-linear and deterministic method to compute the largest eigenpair.\n\nSee also\nRayleigh quotient iteration\nInverse iteration\n\n\n== References ==\n",
