Even untidy HTML web pages can be used as both a source and destination.\nFor SQL/RDBMS backends, it has a database abstraction layer that supports basic connectivity to Postgres, MySQL / MariaDB, IBM Db2, Oracle and MS SQL Server. It uses XML formats (the SQL schema is self-generated) for representation of queries, transformation and merging, making it all processable by scripts.\nWith regards to SQL, QAL uses a subset of SQL features and data types, which while obviously not complete however is sufficient for most usages. It is however easy to instead use backend-specific SQL when the queries do not have to be backend-agnostic.\nIt is currently distributed as a Python Library (.egg) and a Debian package file (.deb).\nIt is related to the Optimal BPM (Business Process Management) project. The Optimal BPM SourceForge project used to be DAL/QAL.\n\nReferences\nThis article incorporates http://sourceforge.net/projects/qal/ text available under the CC0 license.\n\nExternal links\nQAL Documentation and examples\nAPI documentation\n",
