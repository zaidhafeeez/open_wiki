A student writes a program that controls a 'robot' that moves through a city consisting of a rectangular grid of streets (left-right) and avenues (up-down).\nIt is very similar to Guido van Robot (GvR), but RUR-PLE can use all  Python features (while GvR only limited subset of syntax).\nRUR-PLE has 48 lessons (in main European languages and Chinese) with the code and robot environment examples to experiment with.\nA second implementation of RUR-PLE, Rurple NG is in progress.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nRUR-PLE homepage\nRUR-PLE on sourceforge (no longer maintained)\n",
