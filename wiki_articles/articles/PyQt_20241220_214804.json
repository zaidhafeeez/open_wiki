PyQt supports Microsoft Windows as well as various kinds of UNIX, including Linux and MacOS (or Darwin).\nPyQt \n\n## Full Content\n\nPyQt is a Python binding of the cross-platform GUI toolkit Qt, implemented as a Python plug-in. PyQt is free software developed by the British firm Riverbank Computing. It is available under similar terms to Qt versions older than 4.5; this means a variety of licenses including GNU General Public License (GPL) and commercial license, but not the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). PyQt supports Microsoft Windows as well as various kinds of UNIX, including Linux and MacOS (or Darwin).\nPyQt implements around 440 classes and over 6,000 functions and methods including:\n\na substantial set of GUI widgets\nclasses for accessing SQL databases (ODBC, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite)\nQScintilla, Scintilla-based rich text editor widget\ndata aware widgets that are automatically populated from a database\nan XML parser\nSVG support\nclasses for embedding ActiveX controls on Windows (only in commercial version)\nTo automatically generate these bindings, Phil Thompson developed the tool SIP, which is also used in other projects.\n\nHistory\nPyQt was first released by Riverbank Computing in 1998.\nIn August 2009, Nokia sought for the Python binding to be available under the LGPL license. At the time, Nokia owned Qt Software, the developer of QT. After failing to reach an agreement with Riverbank Computing, Nokia released its binding, PySide, providing similar functionality.\n\nMain components\nPyQt4 contains the following Python modules.\n\nThe QtCore module contains the core non-GUI classes, including the event loop and Qt's signal and slot mechanism. It also includes platform independent abstractions for Unicode, threads, mapped files, shared memory, regular expressions, and user and application settings.\nThe QtGui module contains the majority of the GUI classes. These include a number of table, tree and list classes based on the model–view–controller design pattern. Also provided is a sophisticated 2D canvas widget capable of storing thousands of items including ordinary widgets.\nThe QtNetwork module contains classes for writing UDP and TCP clients and servers. It includes classes that implement FTP and HTTP clients and support DNS lookups. Network events are integrated with the event loop making it very easy to develop networked applications.\nThe QtOpenGL module contains classes that enable the use of OpenGL in rendering 3D graphics in PyQt applications.\nThe QtSql module contains classes that integrate with open-source and proprietary SQL databases. It includes editable data models for database tables that can be used with GUI classes. It also includes an implementation of SQLite.\nThe QtSvg module contains classes for displaying the contents of SVG files. It supports the static features of SVG 1.2 Tiny.\nThe QtXml module implements SAX and DOM interfaces to Qt's XML parser.\nThe QtMultimedia module implements low-level multimedia functionality. Application developers would normally use the phonon module.\nThe QtDesigner module contains classes that allow Qt Designer to be extended using PyQt.\nThe Qt module consolidates the classes contained in all of the modules described above into a single module. This has the advantage that you don't have to worry about which underlying module contains a particular class. It has the disadvantage that it loads the whole of the Qt framework, thereby increasing the memory footprint of an application. Whether you use this consolidated module, or the individual component modules is down to personal taste.\nThe uic module implements support for handling the XML files created by Qt Designer that describe the whole or part of a graphical user interface. It includes classes that load an XML file and render it directly, and classes that generate Python code from an XML file for later execution.\nPyQt5 contains the following Python modules:\n\nQtQml Module\nQtQtuick Module\nQtCore Module\nQtGui Module\nQtPrintSupport Module\nQtWidgets Module\nQGLContext Module\nQGLFormat Module\nQGLWidget Module\nQtWebKit Module\nQtWebKitWidgets Module\n\nVersions\nPyQt version 4 works with both Qt 4 and Qt 5. PyQt version 5 only supports Qt version 5, and drops support for features that are deprecated in Qt 5.\n\nHello World example\nThe below code written for PyQt6 shows a small window on the screen.\n\nNotable applications that use PyQt\nAnki, a spaced repetition flashcard program\nCalibre, an E-book management application\nDropbox, a file hosting service\nEric Python IDE\nFrescobaldi, a score editor for LilyPond music files\nKodos, a Python Regular expression Debugger\nLeo, an outliner and literate programming editor\nNinja-IDE, an extensible open-source Python IDE\nOpenLP, an open-source lyrics projection program\nOpenShot, a video editing program\nOrange, a data mining and visualization framework\nPuddletag, an open-source, cross-platform ID3 tag editor\nQGIS, a free software desktop Geographic Information Systems (GIS) application\nqutebrowser, a web browser with Vim-style key bindings and a minimal GUI.\nqt-recordMyDesktop, a Qt4 frontend for recordMyDesktop\nSpyder, a Python data science IDE\nTortoiseHg, a graphical interface for the Mercurial source management program (Hg)\nVeusz, a scientific plotting application\nGNS3, a network software emulator\n\nSee also\nPyGTK (Python wrappers for GTK)\nPySide (Alternative Python wrapper for the Qt toolkit)\nwxPython (Python wrapper for the wx widgets collection)\nKivy\nTkinter (bundled with Python)\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nWillman, Joshua (2020), Beginning PyQt - A Hands-on Approach to GUI Programming (1st ed.), Apress, p. 440, ISBN 978-1-4842-5856-9\nSummerfield, Mark (October 28, 2007), Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt (Covers PyQt4) (1st ed.), Prentice Hall, p. 648, ISBN 978-0-13-235418-9\nRempt, Boudewijn (2002), GUI Programming with Python: QT Edition (Covers PyQt3), OpenDocs, archived from the original on 2010-04-09\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nPyQt and PyKDE community Wiki\nPyQt6 Tutorial Series\nPyQt5 Tutorial Series\nPyQT4 tutorial series\nTutorials\nTutorial\n",
