In contrast, two-dimensional arrays are always rectangular so jagged arrays should not be confused with multidimensional arrays, but the former is often used to emulate the latter.\nArrays of arrays in languages such as Java, PHP, Python (multidimensional lists), Ruby, C#.NET, Visual Basic.NET, Perl, JavaScript, Objective-C, Swift, and Atlas Autocode are implemented as Iliffe vectors.\n\nExamples\nIn C# and Java jagged arrays can be created with the following code:\n\nIn C and C++, a jagged array can be created (on the stack) using the following code:\n\nIn C/C++, jagged arrays can also be created (on the heap) with an array of pointers:\n\nIn C++/CLI, jagged array can be created with the code:\n\nIn Fortran, a jagged array can be created using derived types with allocatable component(s): \n\nIn Python, jagged arrays are not native but one can use list comprehensions to create a multi-dimensional list which supports any dimensional matrix:\n\nSee also\nVariable-length array\nIliffe vector\n\n\n== References ==\n",
