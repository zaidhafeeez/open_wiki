Theano 1.0.0 was then released on 15 November 2017.\nOn 17 May 2018, Chris Fonnesbeck wrote on behalf of the PyMC development team that the PyMC developers will officially assume control of Theano maintenance once the MILA development team steps down. On 29 January 2021, they started using the name Aesara for their fork of Theano.\nOn 29 Nov 2022, the PyMC development team announced that the PyMC developers will fork the Aesara project under the name PyTensor.\n\nSample code\nThe following code is the original Theano's example. It defines a computational graph with 2 scalars a and b of type double and an operation between them (addition) and then creates a Python function f that does the actual computation.\n\nSee also\nComparison of deep learning software\nDifferentiable programming\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website (GitHub)\nTheano at Deep Learning, Université de Montréal\n",
