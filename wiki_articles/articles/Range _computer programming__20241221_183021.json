In the case of an integer, the variable definition is restricted to whole numbers only, and the range will cover every number within its range (including the maximum and minimum). For example, the range of a signed 16-bit integer variable is all the integers from âˆ’32,768 to +32,767.\n\nRange of an array\nWhen an array is numerically indexed, its range is the upper and lower bound of the array. Depending on the environment, a warning, a fatal exception, or unpredictable behavior will occur if the program attempts to access an array element that is outside the range. In some programming languages, such as C, arrays have a fixed lower bound (zero) and will contain data at each position up to the upper bound (so an array with 5 elements will have a range of 0 to 4). In others, such as PHP, an array may have holes where no element is defined, and therefore an array with a range of 0 to 4 will have up to 5 elements (and a minimum of 2).\n\nRange as an alternative to iterator\nAnother meaning of range in computer science is an alternative to iterator. When used in this sense, range is defined as \"a pair of begin/end iterators packed together\". It is argued  that \"Ranges are a superior abstraction\" (compared to iterators) for several reasons, including better safety.\nIn particular, such ranges are supported in C++20, Boost C++ Libraries and the D standard library.\n\nRange as a data type\nA data type for ranges can be implemented using generics.\nExample in C#.\n\nExample in Kotlin.\n\nExample in PHP.\n\nExample in Python.\n\nRust has a built-in range struct in the standard library in std::ops::Range.\n\nRange as a operator\nRust has the .. and ..= operators.\n\nZig also has the .. operator.\n\nPython and PHP does not have any range operator but they do have a range function.\n\nSee also\nInterval\n\n\n== References ==\n",
