Maurer in his article titled A Rose is a Rose...[1]. A Maurer rose consists of some lines that connect some points on a rose curve.\n\n## Full Content\n\nIn geometry, the concept of a Maurer rose was introduced by Peter M. Maurer in his article titled A Rose is a Rose...[1]. A Maurer rose consists of some lines that connect some points on a rose curve.\n\nDefinition\nLet r = sin(nθ) be a rose in the polar coordinate system, where n is a positive integer. The rose has n petals if n is odd, and 2n petals if n is even.\nWe then take 361 points on the rose:\n\n(sin(nk), k) (k = 0, d, 2d, 3d, ..., 360d),\nwhere d is a positive integer and the angles are in degrees, not radians.\n\nExplanation\nA Maurer rose of the rose r = sin(nθ) consists of the 360 lines successively connecting the above 361 points. Thus a Maurer rose is a polygonal curve with vertices on a rose.\nA Maurer rose can be described as a closed route in the polar plane. A walker starts a journey from the origin, (0, 0), and walks along a line to the point (sin(nd), d). Then, in the second leg of the journey, the walker walks along a line to the next point, (sin(n·2d), 2d), and so on. Finally, in the final leg of the journey, the walker walks along a line, from (sin(n·359d), 359d) to the ending point, (sin(n·360d), 360d). The whole route is the Maurer rose of the rose r = sin(nθ). A Maurer rose is a closed curve since the starting point, (0, 0) and the ending point, (sin(n·360d), 360d), coincide.\nThe following figure shows the evolution of a Maurer rose (n = 2, d = 29°).\n\nImages\nThe following are some Maurer roses drawn with some values for n and d:\n\nExample implementation\nUsing Python:\n\nReferences\nMaurer, Peter M.
