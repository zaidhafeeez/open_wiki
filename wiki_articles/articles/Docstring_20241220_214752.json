Unlike conventional source code comments, or even specifically formatted comments like docblocks, docstrings are not stripped from the source tree when it is parsed and are retained throughout the runtime of the program. This allows the programmer to inspect these comments at run time, for instance as an interactive help system, or as metadata.\nLanguages that support docstrings include Python, Lisp, Elixir, Clojure, Gherkin, Julia and Haskell.\n\nImplementation examples\nElixir\nDocumentation is supported at language level, in the form of docstrings. Markdown is Elixir's de facto markup language of choice for use in docstrings:\n\nLisp\nIn Lisp, docstrings are known as documentation strings. The Common Lisp standard states that a particular implementation may choose to discard docstrings whenever they want, for whatever reason. When they are kept, docstrings may be viewed and changed using the DOCUMENTATION function. For instance:\n\nPython\nThe common practice of documenting a code object at the head of its definition is captured by the addition of docstring syntax in the Python language.\nThe docstring for a Python code object (a module, class, or function) is the first statement of that code object, immediately following the definition (the 'def' or 'class' statement). The statement must be a bare string literal, not any other kind of expression. The docstring for the code object is available on that code object's __doc__ attribute and through the help function.\nThe following Python file shows the declaration of docstrings within a Python source file:\n\nAssuming that the above code was saved as mymodule.py, the following is an interactive session showing how the docstrings may be accessed:\n\nTools using docstrings\ncobra -doc (Cobra)\ndoctest (Python)\nEpydoc (Python)\nPydoc (Python)\nSphinx (Python)\n\nSee also\nLiterate programming – alternative code commenting paradigm\nPlain Old Documentation – Perl documentation\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nPython Docstrings at Epydoc's SourceForge page\nDocumentation in GNU Emacs Lisp\nSection from the doxygen documentation about Python docstrings\n",
