It can be used standalone or combined with other tools and frameworks.  It is often used for server-side scripting and dynamic web content by generating HTML, but can also be used to generate source code.  Cheetah is free open-source software licensed under the MIT License.\nTemplating engines encourage clean separation of content, graphic design, and program code. This leads to more modular, flexible, and reusable site architectures, shorter development time, and code that is easier to understand and maintain. Cheetah compiles templates into optimized, yet readable, Python code. It gives template authors full access to any Python data, and functionality, while providing a way for administrators to selectively restrict access to Python when needed.\nCheetah is included in the FreeBSD Ports collection and several Linux distributions: Gentoo, Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu among others.\n\nExample of Cheetah code\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nONLamp.com tutorial Archived 2006-06-16 at the Wayback Machine\nDev Shed tutorial\n",
