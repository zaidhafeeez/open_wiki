SampEn has two advantages over ApEn: data length independence and a relatively trouble-free implementation. Also, there is a small computational difference: In ApEn, the comparison between the template vector (see below) and the rest of the vectors also includes comparison with itself. This guarantees that probabilities \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            ′\n            \n              m\n            \n          \n        \n        (\n        r\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{i}'^{m}(r)}\n  \n are never zero. Consequently, it is always possible to take a logarithm of probabilities. Because template comparisons with itself lower ApEn values, the signals are interpreted to be more regular than they actually are. These self-matches are not included in SampEn. However, since SampEn makes direct use of the correlation integrals, it is not a real measure of information but an approximation. The foundations and differences with ApEn, as well as a step-by-step tutorial for its application is available at.\nSampEn is indeed identical to the \"correlation entropy\" K_2 of Grassberger & Procaccia , except that it is suggested in the latter that certain limits should be taken in order to achieve a result invariant under changes of variables. No such limits and no invariance properties are considered in SampEn.\nThere is a multiscale version of SampEn as well, suggested by Costa and others. SampEn can be used in biomedical and biomechanical research, for example to evaluate postural control.\n\nDefinition\nLike approximate entropy (ApEn), Sample entropy (SampEn) is a measure of complexity. But it does not include self-similar patterns as ApEn does.
