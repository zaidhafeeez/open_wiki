These components communicate entirely through \"inboxes\" and \"outboxes\" (queues) largely removing the burdens of thread-safety and IPC from the developer. This also makes components reusable in different systems, allows easy unit testing and results in parallelism (between components) by default.\nComponents are generally implemented as generators - a method more light-weight than allocating a thread to each (though this is also supported). As a result, switching between the execution of components in Kamaelia systems is very fast.\nApplications that have been produced using Kamaelia include a Freeview digital video recorder, a network-shared whiteboard, a 3D GUI, an HTTP Server, an audio mixer, a stream multicasting system and a simple BitTorrent client.\n\nLicense change\nKamaelia's License changed in July 2010  from the Mozilla tri-license (MPL, GPL and LGPL) to the Apache License, with a note that usage under the old licensing scheme was permitted if necessary (due to license incompatibilities), given the rationale for change was to make the codebase more usable by developers not less.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\n",
