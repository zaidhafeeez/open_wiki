It was known as JPython until 1999.\n\n## Full Content\n\nJython is an implementation of the Python programming language designed to run on the Java platform. It was known as JPython until 1999.\n\nOverview\nJython programs can import and use any Java class. Except for some standard modules, Jython programs use Java classes instead of Python modules. Jython includes almost all of the modules in the standard Python programming language distribution, lacking only some of the modules implemented originally in C. For example, a user interface in Jython could be written with Swing, AWT or SWT. Jython compiles Python source code to Java bytecode (an intermediate language) either on demand or statically.\n\nHistory\nJython was initially created in late 1997 to replace C with Java for performance-intensive code accessed by Python programs, moving to SourceForge in October 2000. The Python Software Foundation awarded a grant in January 2005.  Jython 2.5 was released in June 2009.\n\nStatus and roadmap\nThe most recent release is Jython 2.7.4. It was released on August 18, 2024 and is compatible with Python 2.7.\nPython 3 compatible changes are planned in Jython 3 Roadmap. \nAlthough Jython implements the Python language specification, it has some differences and incompatibilities with CPython, which is the reference implementation of Python.\n\nLicense terms\nFrom version 2.2 on, Jython (including the standard library) is released under the Python Software Foundation License (v2). Older versions are covered by the Jython 2.0, 2.1 license and the JPython 1.1.x Software License.\nThe command-line interpreter is available under the Apache Software License.\n\nUsage\nJBoss Application Server's command line interface scripting using Jython\nOracle Weblogic Server Scripting Tool uses Jython\nIBM Rational development tools allow Jython scripting\nIBM WebSphere Application Server tool scripting with wsadmin allows using Jython and Jacl\nZK – a Java Ajax framework that allows glue logic written in Jython\nIgnition - A software development platform focused on HMI and SCADA\nGhidra - a reverse engineering tool developed by the NSA allows plugins to be written in Java or Jython\nopenHAB - home automation software\n\nSee also\nList of JVM languages\nIronPython – an implementation of Python for .NET and Mono\nPyPy – a self-hosting interpreter for the Python programming language.\nJRuby – similar project for the Ruby programming language.\nGraalVM - a polyglot runtime written in Java, has a Python 3 implementation\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\n",
