It is packaged as an optional part of the Python packaging with many Linux distributions. It is completely written in Python and the Tkinter GUI toolkit (wrapper functions for Tcl/Tk).\nIDLE is intended to be a simple IDE and suitable for beginners, especially in an educational environment. To that end, it is cross-platform, and avoids feature clutter.\nAccording to the included README, its main features are:\n\nMulti-window text editor with syntax highlighting, autocompletion, smart indent and other features.\nPython shell with syntax highlighting.\nIntegrated debugger with stepping, persistent breakpoints, and call stack visibility.\nAuthor Guido van Rossum says IDLE stands for \"Integrated Development and Learning Environment\", and since Van Rossum named the language Python after the British comedy group Monty Python, the name IDLE was probably also chosen partly to honor Eric Idle, one of Monty Python's founding members.\n\nSee also\nList of integrated development environments for Python\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to IDLE at Wikimedia Commons\nIDLE home page in the Python documentation\nIDLE page in the Python wiki\nA guide to using IDLE\n",
