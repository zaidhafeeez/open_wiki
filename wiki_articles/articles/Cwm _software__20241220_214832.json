It is a forward chaining semantic reasoner that can be used for querying, checking, transforming and filtering information.  Its core language is RDF, extended to include rules, it can use RDF/XML or RDF/N3 (see Notation3 Primer) serializations.\ncwm can perform the following tasks:\n\nParse and pretty-print the following RDF formats: XML RDF, Notation3, and N-Triples.\nStore triples in a queryable triplestore (a triples' database).\nPerform inferences as a forward chaining FOPL inference engine.\nPerform builtin functions such as comparing strings, retrieving resources, all using an extensible builtins suite.\ncwm was written in Python from 2000â€“10 onwards by Tim Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly of the W3C.\n\nExternal links\ncwm homepage\nInformation about CWM - TimBL's Closed World Machine\n",
