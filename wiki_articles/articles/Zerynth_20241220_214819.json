It targets 32-bit microcontroller platforms and is designed to mix Python with C code. It connects the microcontrollers to the cloud for developing Internet of Things (IoT) products.\nZerynth is made for designers, engineers, programmers and IoT professionals for product designing and ideation without focusing on low-level configurations and programming.\n\n## Full Content\n\nZerynth is a software implementation of the Python programming language for programming microcontrollers. It targets 32-bit microcontroller platforms and is designed to mix Python with C code. It connects the microcontrollers to the cloud for developing Internet of Things (IoT) products.\nZerynth is made for designers, engineers, programmers and IoT professionals for product designing and ideation without focusing on low-level configurations and programming.\n\nEcosystem\nZerynth's technology allows companies to acquire data from both their legacy machines and new industrial machines, to view data from an interactive dashboard, to receive real-time notifications, and integrates with their existing company’s ERP or other IT systems.\nThe Zerynth IoT Platform allows companies to acquire data from both legacy and new generation machinery, do real-time production monitoring, measure energy consumption, predict malfunctions, gain instant notifications and easily integrate with any existing ERP, MES, or BI systems.\n\nTools\nZerynth Virtual Machine is a multithreaded stack-based virtual machine designed to execute a custom Python bytecode. It has a footprint of around 60–80 kB of Flash and \n3–5 kB of RAM, depending on the target platform and platform SDK. Zerynth VM allows development of Python programs that are independent of the hardware permitting code reusability and integration.\nZerynth Studio is a free, open-source cross-platform IDE empowered by a command line toolchain for provisioning microcontrollers with a Zerynth VM and developing Python programs for it.\nZerynth Advanced Device Manager (ADM) exposes an API-based interface to ease the cloud data forwarding, Firmware over-the-air (FOTA) updates, and Remote Procedure Calling. The software also has an app which allows users to prototype UI for devices programmed with Zerynth.\n\nLicense\nZerynth Studio and Visual Studio Code extension: Open source Apache License 2.0\nZerynth OS: closed source. Distributed as binary.\nZerynth Toolchain: Open source Apache License 2.0\nZerynth Official Libraries: Open source Apache License 2.0\nZerynth Cloud: closed source. Provided as SAAS or on-premises\n\nFunding\nAccording to Tech.eu, as of November 2022, \"Zerynth raised €5.3 million, which brings its lifetime funding  to €7.3 million, following a €2 million injection two years back. The funding round was led by United Ventures.\" However, as of 2022, Zerynth, the company managing the Zerynth software, had a revenue of €629.656, down from 2021 revenue of €895.064, and a negative return of €−2.357.356 \n\n\n== References ==\n",
