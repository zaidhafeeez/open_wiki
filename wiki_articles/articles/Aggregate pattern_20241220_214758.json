Both uses deal with considering a large case as composed of smaller, simpler, pieces.\n\n## Full Content\n\nAn Aggregate pattern can refer to concepts in either statistics or computer programming. Both uses deal with considering a large case as composed of smaller, simpler, pieces.\n\nStatistics\nAn aggregate pattern is an important statistical concept in many fields that rely on statistics to predict the behavior of large groups, based on the tendencies of subgroups to consistently behave in a certain way. It is particularly useful in sociology, economics, psychology, and criminology.\n\nComputer programming\nIn Design Patterns, an aggregate is not a design pattern but rather refers to an object such as a list, vector, or generator which provides an interface for creating iterators. The following example code is in Python.\n\nPython hides essentially all of the details using the iterator protocol. Confusingly, Design Patterns uses \"aggregate\" to refer to the blank in the code for x in ___: which is unrelated to the term \"aggregation\". Neither of these terms refer to the statistical aggregation of data such as the act of adding up the Fibonacci sequence or taking the average of a list of numbers.\n\nSee also\nVisitor pattern\nTemplate class\nFacade pattern\nType safety\nFunctional programming\n\n\n== References ==\n",
