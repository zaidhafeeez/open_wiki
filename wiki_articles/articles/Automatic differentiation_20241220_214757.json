By applying the chain rule repeatedly to these operations, partial derivatives of arbitrary order can be computed automatically, accurately to working precision, and using at most a small constant factor of more arithmetic operations than the original program.\n\nDifference from other differentiation methods\nAutomatic differentiation is distinct from symbolic differentiation and numerical differentiation. \nSymbolic differentiation faces the difficulty of converting a computer program into a single mathematical expression and can lead to inefficient code. Numerical differentiation (the method of finite differences) can introduce round-off errors in the discretization process and cancellation. Both of these classical methods have problems with calculating higher derivatives, where complexity and errors increase. Finally, both of these classical methods are slow at computing partial derivatives of a function with respect to many inputs, as is needed for gradient-based optimization algorithms. Automatic differentiation solves all of these problems.\n\nApplications\nAutomatic differentiation is particularly important in the field of machine learning. For example, it allows one to implement backpropagation in a neural network without a manually-computed derivative.\n\nForward and reverse accumulation\nChain rule of partial derivatives of composite functions\nFundamental to automatic differentiation is the decomposition of differentials provided by the chain rule of partial derivatives of composite functions.

In contrast, reverse accumulation requires the evaluated partial functions for the partial derivatives. Reverse accumulation therefore evaluates the function first and calculates the derivatives with respect to all independent variables in an additional pass.\nWhich of these two types should be used depends on the sweep count. The computational complexity of one sweep is proportional to the complexity of the original code.\n\nForward accumulation is more efficient than reverse accumulation for functions f : Rn → Rm with n ≪ m as only n sweeps are necessary, compared to m sweeps for reverse accumulation.\nReverse accumulation is more efficient than forward accumulation for functions f : Rn → Rm with n ≫ m as only m sweeps are necessary, compared to n sweeps for forward accumulation.\nBackpropagation of errors in multilayer perceptrons, a technique used in machine learning, is a special case of reverse accumulation.\nForward accumulation was introduced by R.E. Wengert in 1964. According to Andreas Griewank, reverse accumulation has been suggested since the late 1960s, but the inventor is unknown. Seppo Linnainmaa published reverse accumulation in 1976.\n\nForward accumulation\nIn forward accumulation AD, one first fixes the independent variable with respect to which differentiation is performed and computes the derivative of each sub-expression recursively.

chain rule from outside to inside, or in the case of the computational graph in Figure 3, from top to bottom. The example function is scalar-valued, and thus there is only one seed for the derivative computation, and only one sweep of the computational graph is needed to calculate the (two-component) gradient. This is only half the work when compared to forward accumulation, but reverse accumulation requires the storage of the intermediate variables wi as well as the instructions that produced them in a data structure known as a \"tape\" or a Wengert list (however, Wengert published forward accumulation, not reverse accumulation), which may consume significant memory if the computational graph is large. This can be mitigated to some extent by storing only a subset of the intermediate variables and then reconstructing the necessary work variables by repeating the evaluations, a technique known as rematerialization. Checkpointing is also used to save intermediary states.\n\nThe operations to compute the derivative using reverse accumulation are shown in the table below (note the reversed order):\n\nThe data flow graph of a computation can be manipulated to calculate the gradient of its original calculation. This is done by adding an adjoint node for each primal node, connected by adjoint edges which parallel the primal edges but flow in the opposite direction. The nodes in the adjoint graph represent multiplication by the derivatives of the functions calculated by the nodes in the primal. For instance, addition in the primal causes fanout in the adjoint; fanout in the primal causes addition in the adjoint; a unary function y = f(x) in the primal causes x̄ = ȳ f′(x) in the adjoint; etc.\n\nImplementation\nPseudo code\nReverse accumulation requires two passes: In the forward pass, the function is evaluated first and the partial results are cached. In the reverse pass, the partial derivatives are calculated and the previously derived value is backpropagated. The corresponding method call expects the expression Z to be derived and seed with the derived value of the parent expression. For the top expression, Z derived with regard to Z, this is 1. The method traverses the expression tree recursively until a variable is reached and adds the current seed value to the derivative expression.\n\nC++\nBeyond forward and reverse accumulation\nForward and reverse accumulation are just two (extreme) ways of traversing the chain rule. The problem of computing a full Jacobian of f : Rn → Rm with a minimum number of arithmetic operations is known as the optimal Jacobian accumulation (OJA) problem, which is NP-complete. Central to this proof is the idea that algebraic dependencies may exist between the local partials that label the edges of the graph. In particular, two or more edge labels may be recognized as equal. The complexity of the problem is still open if it is assumed that all edge labels are unique and algebraically independent.\n\nAutomatic differentiation using dual numbers\nForward mode automatic differentiation is accomplished by augmenting the algebra of real numbers and obtaining a new arithmetic. An additional component is added to every number to represent the derivative of a function at the number, and all arithmetic operators are extended for the augmented algebra. The augmented algebra is the algebra of dual numbers.\nReplace every number \n  \n    \n      \n        \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\,x}\n  \n with the number \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        +\n        \n          x\n          ′\n        \n        ε\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x+x'\\varepsilon }\n  \n, where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          ′\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x'}\n  \n is a real number, but \n  \n    \n      \n        ε\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varepsilon }\n  \n is an abstract number with the property \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ε\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varepsilon ^{2}=0}\n  \n (an infinitesimal; see Smooth infinitesimal analysis).

Note that in many optimization applications, the directional derivative is indeed sufficient.\n\nHigh order and many variables\nThe above arithmetic can be generalized to calculate second order and higher derivatives of multivariate functions. However, the arithmetic rules quickly grow complicated: complexity is quadratic in the highest derivative degree. Instead, truncated Taylor polynomial algebra can be used. The resulting arithmetic, defined on generalized dual numbers, allows efficient computation using functions as if they were a data type. Once the Taylor polynomial of a function is known, the derivatives are easily extracted.\n\nImplementation\nForward-mode AD is implemented by a nonstandard interpretation of the program in which real numbers are replaced by dual numbers, constants are lifted to dual numbers with a zero epsilon coefficient, and the numeric primitives are lifted to operate on dual numbers. This nonstandard interpretation is generally implemented using one of two strategies: source code transformation or operator overloading.\n\nSource code transformation (SCT)\nThe source code for a function is replaced by an automatically generated source code that includes statements for calculating the derivatives interleaved with the original instructions.\nSource code transformation can be implemented for all programming languages, and it is also easier for the compiler to do compile time optimizations. However, the implementation of the AD tool itself is more difficult and the build system is more complex.\n\nOperator overloading (OO)\nOperator overloading is a possibility for source code written in a language supporting it. Objects for real numbers and elementary mathematical operations must be overloaded to cater for the augmented arithmetic depicted above. This requires no change in the form or sequence of operations in the original source code for the function to be differentiated, but often requires changes in basic data types for numbers and vectors to support overloading and often also involves the insertion of special flagging operations. Due to the inherent operator overloading overhead on each loop, this approach usually demonstrates weaker speed performance.\n\nOperator overloading and source code transformation\nOverloaded Operators can be used to extract the valuation graph, followed by automatic generation of the AD-version of the primal function at run-time. Unlike the classic OO AAD, such AD-function does not change from one iteration to the next one. Hence there is any OO or tape interpretation run-time overhead per Xi sample.\nWith the AD-function being generated at runtime, it can be optimised to take into account the current state of the program and precompute certain values. In addition, it can be generated in a way to consistently utilize native CPU vectorization to process 4(8)-double chunks of user data (AVX2\\AVX512 speed up x4-x8). With multithreading added into account, such approach can lead to a final acceleration of order 8 × #Cores compared to the traditional AAD tools. A reference implementation is available on GitHub.\n\nSee also\nDifferentiable programming\n\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nRall, Louis B. (1981).
