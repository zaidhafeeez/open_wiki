QuTiP allows simulation of Hamiltonians with arbitrary time-dependence, allowing simulation of situations of interest in quantum optics, ion trapping, superconducting circuits and quantum nanomechanical resonators.  The library includes extensive visualization facilities for content under simulations.\nQuTiP's API provides a Python interface and uses Cython to allow run-time compilation and extensions via C and C++.  QuTiP is built to work well with popular Python packages NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and IPython.\n\nHistory\nThe idea for the QuTip project was conceived in 2010 by PhD student Paul Nation, who was using the quantum optics toolbox for MATLAB in his research. According to Paul Nation, he wanted to create a python package similar to qotoolbox because he \"was not a big fan of MATLAB\" and then decided to \"just write it [him]self\".  As a postdoctoral fellow, at the RIKEN Institute in Japan, he met Robert Johansson and the two worked together on the package. \nIn contrast to its predecessor qotoolbox, which relies on the proprietary MATLAB environment, it was published in 2012 under an open source license.\nThe Version created by Nation and Johansson already contained the most important features of the package, but QuTips scope and features are constantly being extended by a large community of contributors. It has grown in popularity amongst physicists, with over 250.000 downloads in the year 2021.\n\nExamples\nCreating quantum objects\nBasic operations\nTime evolution\nSimulating a non-unitary time evolution according to the Lindblad Master Equation is possible with the qutip.mesolve function\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nqutip on GitHub\n",
