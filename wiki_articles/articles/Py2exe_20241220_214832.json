These executables can run on a system without Python installed. It is the most common tool for doing so.\npy2exe was used to distribute the official BitTorrent client (before the version 6.0) and is still used to distribute SpamBayes as well as other projects.\nSince May 2014, version 0.9.2.0 of py2exe is available for Python 3. Before then, py2exe was made only for Python 2, and it was necessary to use an alternative like cx_Freeze for Python 3 code.\nAlthough this program transforms a .py file to an .exe, it does not make it run faster because py2exe bundles the Python bytecode without converting it to machine-code. It may even run slower than using the Python interpreter directly because of startup overhead.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nAlternative: PyInstaller (also supports Linux, Mac OS X, and other platforms)\nAlternative: cx_Freeze (supports all platforms that Python itself works on)\n",
