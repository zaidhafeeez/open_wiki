This further suggests that the global average of length of daytime on any given day is 12 hours without considering the effect of atmospheric refraction.\n\nGeneralized equation\nThe equation above neglects the influence of atmospheric refraction (which lifts the solar disc — i.e. makes the solar disc appear higher in the sky — by approximately 0.6° when it is on the horizon) and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc — i.e. the apparent diameter of the sun — (about 0.5°). The times of the rising and the setting of the upper solar limb as given in astronomical almanacs correct for this by using the more general equation\n\n  \n    \n      \n        cos\n        ⁡\n        \n          ω\n          \n            ∘\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                sin\n                ⁡\n                a\n                −\n                sin\n                ⁡\n                ϕ\n                ×\n                sin\n                ⁡\n                δ\n              \n              \n                cos\n                ⁡\n                ϕ\n                ×\n                cos\n                ⁡\n                δ\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\cos \\omega _{\\circ }={\\dfrac {\\sin a-\\sin \\phi \\times \\sin \\delta }{\\cos \\phi \\times \\cos \\delta }}}\n  \n\nwith the altitude angle (a) of the center of the solar disc set to about −0.83° (or −50 arcminutes).\nThe above general equation can be also used for any other solar altitude. The NOAA provides additional approximate expressions for refraction corrections at these other altitudes. There are also alternative formulations, such as a non-piecewise expression by G.G. Bennett used in the U.S. Naval Observatory's \"Vector Astronomy Software\".\n\nComplete calculation on Earth\nThe generalized equation relies on a number of other variables which need to be calculated before it can itself be calculated.
