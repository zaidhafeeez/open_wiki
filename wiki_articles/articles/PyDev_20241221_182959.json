It is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for programming in Python supporting code refactoring, graphical debugging, code analysis among other features.\n\n## Full Content\n\nPyDev is a third-party plug-in for Eclipse. It is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for programming in Python supporting code refactoring, graphical debugging, code analysis among other features.\n\nHistory\nPyDev was originally created by Aleks Totic in July 2003, but Fabio Zadrozny became the project's main developer in January 2005. In September of that same year, PyDev Extensions was started as a commercial counterpart of PyDev, offering features such as code analysis and remote debugging.\nIn July 2008, Aptana acquired PyDev, retaining Zadrozny as the project head. They open sourced PyDev Extensions in September 2009, and merged it with PyDev.\nWhen Appcelerator acquired Aptana in January 2011, they acquired PyDev by extension. Zadrozny was kept as head of the project. Since then, development of PyDev has accelerated.\nIn March 2011, PyDev 2.0 was released with TDD actions support, and in April of the following year, version 2.5 was released with Django support. May 2013 saw a major milestone as PyDev raised more than its target in a successful crowd sourcing round to continue development, and version 2.7.5 was released. The campaign also funded Zadrozny's creation of LiClipse, a paid closed source fork of Eclipse which bundles PyDev by default.\nPyDev received improvements to type inference and a notable increase in contributions to code base when version 2.8 was released in July 2013. Since then, numerous additional improvements have been made to PyDev and it has gained many positive reviews.\nVersion 5.4.0 was released on November 30, 2016. The main new feature of this release is support for Python 3.6.\n\nFeatures\nBelow there are some of the features available (version 2.7.5):\n\nCPython, Jython and IronPython support\nCode completion\nCode completion with auto-import\nCode analysis (with quick-fix for problems found in code analysisâ€”Ctrl+1)\nDebugger\nDjango\nRemote Debugger (allows debugging scripts not launched from within Eclipse)\nDebug console (allows interactive probing in suspended mode)\nInteractive console\nPython 2.x and 3.x syntax\nBasic syntax highlighting\nParser errors\nOutline view\nTabs or spaces preferences\nSmart indent / dedent\nComment / uncomment / comment blocks\nCode folding\nGo to definition\nCode coverage\nMark occurrences\nPylint integration\nTODO tasks\nContent Assistants (Ctrl+1)\nAssign result to attribute or local\nSurround code with try..catch / finally\nCreate docstring\nMove import to global scope\nKeywords presented as auto-completions as you type\nQuick-outline\n\nPyDev extensions\nUntil September 2009, two versions of PyDev existed: an open-source version, and a shareware version called PyDev Extensions.  Certain advanced features such as code analysis, quick-fixes, and remote debugging were reserved for the non-free version.  On September 3, 2009, Aptana announced PyDev version 1.5, a combined version of PyDev and PyDev Extensions, all available under the Eclipse Public License.\n\nSee also\nEclipse\nComparison of Python integrated development environments\nKomodo Edit\nPyCharm\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\n",
