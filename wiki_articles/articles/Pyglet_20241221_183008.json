Images, video, and sound files in a range of formats can be done natively but can also be expanded with the libav and ffmpeg libraries. It requires no external dependencies.\nText display and formatting\n\nRich text formatting (bold, italic, underline, color change, background color, indent, lists) (pyglet.text.formats)\nBuilt-in layouts to support editable text\nCarets (pyglet.text.caret.Caret)\nHTML support (pyglet.text.layout.IncrementalTextLayout)\nImage and sprite work\n\nFast image processing and rendering\nBuilt-in sprites (pyglet.sprite)\nAnimated images (*.gif)\nGraphics\n\nOpenGL shaders supported\nSimple built-in shapes (rectangles, circles, triangles) (pyglet.shapes)\nBatched rendering (pyglet.graphics.Batch)\n3D model rendering\nEvents and file system\n\nResource management (pyglet.resource)\nClock for processing events and time (pyglet.clock.Clock)\nWindow events (pyglet.window.Window)\nEvent dispatching (pyglet.event.EventDispatcher)\nContext management\nSprites, text layouts, and text functions are implemented. Multi-level lists are supported and can be created using HTML. Different sections of the displayed document can have distinct styles. A built-in caret provides support for text editing, resembling many features of a UI text input caret.\n\nExample\nIn this example, lines 1-2 import the pyglet module's necessary components. Line 4 creates a window, and line 6 calls pyglet to run its event loop. Optionally an update rate (in frames per second) can be specified in a rate parameter.\n\nSee also\nPygame, another Python game API, a layer over Simple DirectMedia Layer\nKivy (framework), a Python OpenGL-based UI for multitouch interactions\nCocos2d\nPanda3D\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nOfficial documentation\nAVbin, the wrapper for libav\n",
