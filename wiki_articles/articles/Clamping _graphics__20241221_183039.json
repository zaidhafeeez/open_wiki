Unlike wrapping, clamping merely moves the point to the nearest available value.\n\nIn Python, clamping can be defined as follows:\n\nThis is equivalent to max(minimum, min(x, maximum)) for languages that support the functions min and max.\n\nUses\nSeveral programming languages and libraries provide functions for fast and vectorized clamping. In Python, the pandas library offers the Series.clip and DataFrame.clip methods. The NumPy library offers the clip function. In the Wolfram Language, it is implemented as Clip[x, {minimum, maximum}].\nIn OpenGL, the glClearColor function takes four GLfloat values which are then 'clamped' to the range \n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [0,1]}\n  \n.\nOne of the many uses of clamping in computer graphics is the placing of a detail inside a polygonâ€”for example, a bullet hole on a wall. It can also be used with wrapping to create a variety of effects.\n\n\n== References ==\n",
