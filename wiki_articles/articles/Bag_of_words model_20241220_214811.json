It is used in natural language processing and information retrieval (IR). It disregards word order (and thus most of syntax or grammar) but captures multiplicity.\nThe bag-of-words model is commonly used in methods of document classification where, for example, the (frequency of) occurrence of each word is used as a feature for training a classifier. It has also been used for computer vision.\nAn early reference to \"bag of words\" in a linguistic context can be found in Zellig Harris's 1954 article on Distributional Structure.\n\nDefinition\nThe following models a text document using bag-of-words. Here are two simple text documents:\n\nBased on these two text documents, a list is constructed as follows for each document:\n\nRepresenting each bag-of-words as a JSON object, and attributing to the respective JavaScript variable:\n\nEach key is the word, and each value is the number of occurrences of that word in the given text document.\nThe order of elements is free, so, for example {\"too\":1,\"Mary\":1,\"movies\":2,\"John\":1,\"watch\":1,\"likes\":2,\"to\":1} is also equivalent to BoW1. It is also what we expect from a strict JSON object representation.\nNote: if another document is like a union of these two,\n\nits JavaScript representation will be:\n\nSo, as we see in the bag algebra, the \"union\" of two documents in the bags-of-words representation is, formally, the disjoint union, summing the multiplicities of each element.\n  \n    \n      \n        B\n        o\n        W\n        3\n        =\n        B\n        o\n        W\n        1\n        ⨄\n        B\n        o\n        W\n        2\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle BoW3=BoW1\\biguplus BoW2}\n\nWord order\nThe BoW representation of a text removes all word ordering. For example, the BoW representation of \"man bites dog\" and \"dog bites man\" are the same, so any algorithm that operates with a BoW representation of text must treat them in the same way. Despite this lack of syntax or grammar, BoW representation is fast and may be sufficient for simple tasks that do not require word order. For instance, for document classification, if the words \"stocks\" \"trade\" \"investors\" appears multiple times, then the text is likely a financial report, even though it would be insufficient to distinguish between Yesterday, investors were rallying, but today, they are retreating.andYesterday, investors were retreating, but today, they are rallying.and so the BoW representation would be insufficient to determine the detailed meaning of the document.\n\nImplementations\nImplementations of the bag-of-words model might involve using frequencies of words in a document to represent its contents. The frequencies can be \"normalized\" by the inverse of document frequency, or tf–idf. Additionally, for the specific purpose of classification, supervised alternatives have been developed to account for the class label of a document. Lastly, binary (presence/absence or 1/0) weighting is used in place of frequencies for some problems (e.g., this option is implemented in the WEKA machine learning software system).\n\nPython implementation\nHashing trick\nA common alternative to using dictionaries is the hashing trick, where words are mapped directly to indices with a hashing function. Thus, no memory is required to store a dictionary. Hash collisions are typically dealt via freed-up memory to increase the number of hash buckets. In practice, hashing simplifies the implementation of bag-of-words models and improves scalability.\n\nSee also\nAdditive smoothing\nFeature extraction\nMachine learning\nMinHash\nVector space model\nw-shingling\n\nNotes\nReferences\nMcTear, Michael (et al) (2016).
