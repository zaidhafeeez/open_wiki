The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.\n\n## Full Content\n\nIn most computer programming languages, a while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.\n\nOverview\nThe while construct consists of a block of code and a condition/expression. The condition/expression is evaluated, and if the condition/expression is true, the code within all of their following in the block is executed. This repeats until the condition/expression becomes false. Because the while loop checks the condition/expression before the block is executed, the control structure is often also known as a pre-test loop. Compare this with the do while loop, which tests the condition/expression after the loop has executed.\nFor example, in the languages C, Java, C#, Objective-C, and C++, (which use the same syntax in this case), the code fragment\n\nfirst checks whether x is less than 5, which it is, so then the {loop body} is entered, where the printf function is run and x is incremented by 1. After completing all the statements in the loop body, the condition, (x < 5), is checked again, and the loop is executed again, this process repeating until the variable x has the value 5.\nIt is possible, and in some cases desirable, for the condition to always evaluate to true, creating an infinite loop. When such a loop is created intentionally, there is usually another control structure (such as a break statement) that controls termination of the loop.\nFor example:\n\nDemonstrating while loops\nThese while loops will calculate the factorial of the number 5:\n\nActionScript 3\nAda\nAPL\nor simply\n\nAutoHotkey\nSmall Basic\nVisual Basic\nBourne (Unix) shell\nC, C++\nColdFusion Markup Language (CFML)\nScript syntax\nTag syntax\nFortran\nGo\nGo has no while statement, but it has the function of a for statement when omitting some elements of the for statement.\n\nJava, C#, D\nThe code for the loop is the same for Java, C# and D:\n\nJavaScript\nLua\nMATLAB, Octave\nMathematica\nOberon, Oberon-2, Oberon-07, Component Pascal\nMaya Embedded Language\nNim\nNon-terminating while loop:\n\nPascal\nPascal has two forms of the while loop, while and repeat. While repeats one statement (unless enclosed in a begin-end block) as long as the condition is true. The repeat statement repetitively executes a block of one or more statements through an until statement and continues repeating unless the condition is false. The main difference between the two is the while loop may execute zero times if the condition is initially false, the repeat-until loop always executes at least once.\n\nPerl\nWhile loops are frequently used for reading data line by line (as defined by the $/ line separator) from open filehandles:\n\nPHP\nPL/I\nPython\nNon-terminating while loop:\n\nRacket\nIn Racket, as in other Scheme implementations, a named-let is a popular way to implement loops:\n\nUsing a macro system, implementing a while loop is a trivial exercise (commonly used to introduce macros):\n\nHowever, an imperative programming style is often discouraged in Scheme and Racket.\n\nRuby\nRust\nSmalltalk\nContrary to other languages, in Smalltalk a while loop is not a language construct but defined in the class BlockClosure as a method with one parameter, the body as a closure, using self as the condition.\nSmalltalk also has a corresponding whileFalse: method.\n\nSwift\nTcl\nVEX\nPowerShell\nWhile (language)\nWhile is a simple programming language constructed from assignments, sequential composition, conditionals, and while statements, used in the theoretical analysis of imperative programming language semantics.\n\nSee also\nDo while loop\nFor loop\nForeach\nPrimitive recursive function\nGeneral recursive function\nLOOP (programming language) â€“ a programming language with the property that the functions it can compute are exactly the primitive recursive functions\n\n\n== References ==\n",
