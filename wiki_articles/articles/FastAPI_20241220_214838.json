It uses Pydantic and type hints to validate, serialize and deserialize data. FastAPI also automatically generates OpenAPI documentation for APIs built with it. It was first released in 2018.\n\n## Full Content\n\nFastAPI is a high-performance web framework for building HTTP-based service APIs in Python 3.8+.  It uses Pydantic and type hints to validate, serialize and deserialize data. FastAPI also automatically generates OpenAPI documentation for APIs built with it. It was first released in 2018.\n\nComponents\nPydantic\nPydantic is a data validation library for Python. While writing code in an IDE, Pydantic provides type hints for schema validation and serialization through type annotations.\n\nStarlette\nStarlette is a lightweight ASGI framework/toolkit, to support async functionality in Python.\n\nUvicorn\nUvicorn is a minimal low-level server/application web server for async frameworks, following the ASGI specification. Technically, it implements a multi-process model with one main process, which is responsible for managing a pool of worker processes and distributing incoming HTTP requests to them. The number of worker processes is pre-configured, but can also be adjusted up or down at runtime.\n\nOpenAPI Integration\nFastAPI automatically generates OpenAPI documentation for your APIs. This documentation includes both Swagger UI and ReDoc, which provide interactive API documentation that you can use to explore and test your endpoints in real time. This is particularly useful for developing, testing, and sharing APIs with other developers or users.\n\nExample\nThe following code shows a simple web application that displays \"Hello World!\" when visited:\n\nSee also\nDjango (web framework)\nFlask (web framework)\nPylons project\nWeb2py\nTornado (web server)\nComparison of server-side web frameworks ยง Python\nREST\nPython (programming language)\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website \nfastapi on GitHub\n\n\n== References ==\n",
