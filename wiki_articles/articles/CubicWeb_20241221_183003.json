It is written in Python.\nIt has been an open free software project since October 2008, but the project began in 2000, and was initially developed by Logilab for internal uses such as intranet, bug tracker and forge applications.\nAs of 2012, CubicWeb is being used in large-scale semantic web and linked open data applications, and international corporations.\n\n## Full Content\n\nCubicWeb is a free and open-source semantic web application framework, licensed under the LGPL. It is written in Python.\nIt has been an open free software project since October 2008, but the project began in 2000, and was initially developed by Logilab for internal uses such as intranet, bug tracker and forge applications.\nAs of 2012, CubicWeb is being used in large-scale semantic web and linked open data applications, and international corporations.\n\nConcepts\nThe framework is entirely driven by a data model. Once the data model is defined, one gets a functional web application and can further customize the views (by default it provides a set of default views for each type of data).\nA cube is a reusable component defining specific features. For example, a cube forge allows one to create one's own forge and the forge cube reuses the cubes comment, file, email, etc. Interesting general purpose cubes include dbpedia and openlibrary.\nThe framework has been translated to English, French, Spanish and German (April 2011).\n\nFunctions\nSemantic web: supports OWL/RDF\nMulti-source: supports RQL, SQL, LDAP, Subversion and Mercurial\nRQL: Relationship query language to ease data querying\nMigration tool: fits into agile development\nView selection principle: the engine selects the best view to fit the content to display according to the context\nCubes library: a wide range of cubes are available on the forge\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nGrehan, Rick (10 August 2011). \"Pillars of Python: CubicWeb Web framework\".
