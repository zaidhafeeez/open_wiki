Similar to the functionality of Perldoc within Perl and Javadoc within Java, Pydoc allows Python programmers to access Python's documentation help files, generate text and HTML pages with documentation specifics, and find the appropriate module for a particular job. \nPydoc can be accessed from a module-specific GUI, from within the Python interpreter, or from a command line shell.\nDeveloped by Ka-Ping Yee, it is included by default in all versions of Python since Python 2.1 and is available for download for 1.5.2, 1.6, and 2.0. \nPydoc is used to extract documentation from the source code itself. More comprehensive documentation is generated from external reStructuredText documents using the Sphinx documentation system.\n\nSee also\nComparison of documentation generators\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nArchive of Pydoc for Python versions 1.5 to 2.5\nOpen source package library for PyPI\nSphinx documentation\n",
