It offers a range of options for parallelising Python code for CPUs and GPUs, often with only minor code changes.\nNumba was started by Travis Oliphant in 2012 and has since been under active development at its repository in GitHub with frequent releases. The project is driven by developers at Anaconda, Inc., with support by DARPA, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Intel, Nvidia and AMD, and a community of contributors on GitHub.\n\nExample\nNumba can be used by simply applying the numba.jit decorator to a Python function that does numerical computations:\n\nThe just-in-time compilation happens transparently when the function is called:\n\nNumba's website  contains many more examples, as well as information on how to get good performance from Numba.\n\nGPU support\nNumba can compile Python functions to GPU code. Initially two backends are available:\n\nNvidia CUDA, see numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/cuda\nAMD ROCm HSA, see numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/roc\nSince release 0.56.4, AMD ROCm HSA has been officially moved to unmaintained status and a separate repository stub has been created for it.\n\nAlternative approaches\nNumba is one approach to make Python fast, by compiling specific functions that contain\nPython and NumPy code. Many alternative approaches for fast numeric computing with Python exist, such as Cython, Pythran, and PyPy.\n\n\n== References ==\n",
