Spyce, which also claims the phrase "Python Server Pages", was first released in 2002.
The Webware for Python suite also contains an implementation of Python Server Pages released as early as 2000.
An earlier tool with a similar function also called Python Server Pages but based on Java and JPython was first released in 1999.
It was one of the earliest web development support in Python and has long since been surpassed in popularity by systems such as Django or Flask.
