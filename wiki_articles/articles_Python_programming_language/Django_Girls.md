Django Girls is an international non-profit organization started by two Polish women, Ola Sitarska and Ola Sendecka, to inspire women from all backgrounds to get interested in technology and to become programmers, offering a safe and friendly environment.

History
The first Django Girls workshop, which kicked off Django Girls, happened during EuroPython 2014, in Berlin.  Ola Sitarska and Ola Sendecka decided to use Django and Python because both are open source code platforms, which may help women developing their own ideas. Since then, the initiative has spread worldwide, reaching countries like Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Ghana, Nigeria, United Kingdom, Peru, United States, Zimbabwe and many others.

Tutorial

As of May 2018, the Django Girls tutorial has been published online in 14 languages besides its original English version. As of May 2018, more than 1,000,000 users have visited its website.

Django Girls workshops
Using a manual provided by the organization, Django Girls volunteers offer free one or two days workshops in many cities of the world, usually held during weekends. It is aimed at complete beginners, teaching about HTML, CSS, Python and Django.
