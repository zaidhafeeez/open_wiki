## Summary
PythonAnywhere is an online integrated development environment (IDE) and web hosting service (Platform as a service) based on the Python programming language.  Founded by Giles Thomas and Robert Smithson in 2012, it provides in-browser access to server-based Python and Bash command-line interfaces, along with a code editor with syntax highlighting.  Program files can be transferred to and from the service using the user's browser.  Web applications hosted by the service can be written using any WSGI-based application framework.
PythonAnywhere was created by Resolver Systems, who also produced Resolver One, a Python-based Spreadsheet program. On 16 October 2012 the product was acquired by a new company, PythonAnywhere LLP, who took on the existing development team.  In June, 2022, PythonAnywhere was acquired by Anaconda, Inc.
The development team uses PythonAnywhere to develop PythonAnywhere, and say that its collaboration features help because they use the extreme programming methodology.
