## Summary

Storm is a Python programming library for object-relational mapping between one or more SQL databases and Python objects.  It allows Python developers to formulate complex queries spanning multiple database tables to support dynamic storage and retrieval of object information.
MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite database support is built into Storm, and the API allows for support for others. Storm also supports the Django and Zope web frameworks natively. Twisted support is planned for the .20 release.
