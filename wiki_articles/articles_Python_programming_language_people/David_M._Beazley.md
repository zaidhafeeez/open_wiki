Biography
Beazley received his BA from Fort Lewis College in 1991 and his MS from the University of Oregon in 1993, both in mathematics. He then joined the PhD program in computer science at the University of Utah and worked at the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute. During his PhD, he worked in the Theoretical Physics Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he helped develop high-performance simulation software for parallel computing. He was the primary developer of SPaSM (Scalable Parallel Short-range Molecular dynamics), for which he won the IEEE Gordon Bell Prize in 1993 and in 1998.
Following his PhD in 1998, he joined the Computer Science Department at the University of Chicago, and received a National Science Foundation CAREER Awards to investigate the development of mixed-language software tools. He won the Best Paper Award at PyCon 2001 for developing the Wrapped Application Debugger (WAD), which converts fatal exception errors into Python exceptions. In 2005, he left the University to start a consulting company, Dabeaz LLC, to focus on developing Python tools and learning resources.
