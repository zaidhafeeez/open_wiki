PyCon 2020 was listed as one of "The best software engineering conferences [to attend] of 2020" and "As Python becomes ever more popular in the scientific community and for big data, the influence of PyCon will continue to grow." PyCon is often attended by Guido van Rossum (the author of the Python language). Other groups, such as PyLadies and Django Girls, often have concurrent sessions.
It is sometimes referred to in software documentation and conference papers.
It is organised by the Python Software Foundation, and is supported by many significant companies, including Microsoft, Google, and Facebook.
