Content
Core Python Programming is divided into two parts with a total of 23 chapters, as well as an index.

Part I
The first part of Core Python Programming, Core Python, deals with the basic aspects of the Python programming language. Chapters One and Two, named What is Python? and Getting Started respectively, give instructions on how to install and configure Python, as well as detailing the basic operators and simple statements. Part One continues to cover Sequences (Lists, Strings and Tuples), Built-in Functions and creating functions, Loops (for-loop, while loop and if-statement being the most common); Modules, a full explanation on what Object Oriented Programming is; and syntax.

Part II
Part Two, Advanced Topics, contains information about the more complex aspects of Python, such as GUI programming. Other topics covered include regular expressions, network programming, multithreaded programming, web programming and database programming.
